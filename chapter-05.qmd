# Definitions of qualifiers

[**Before using the qualifiers, please read the 'Rules for naming soils' (Chapter 2).**]{style="color:red"}

The definitions of the qualifiers for the second-level units relate to RSGs, diagnostic horizons, properties and materials, and to attributes such as colour, chemical conditions, texture, etc. References to the RSGs defined in Chapter 4 and the diagnostics listed in Chapter 3 are shown *in italics*.

Usually, only a limited number of combinations will be possible in a soil name; many of the definitions make the qualifiers mutually exclusive.

## General rules

1.  **Subqualifiers** (see Chapter 2.3), **which may be used in the soil name instead of the qualifier listed in the Key** (Chapter 4), are found beneath the definition of the respective qualifier (e.g. Protocalcic is found under Calcic). **Subqualifiers, which cannot replace a listed qualifier**, are found in alphabetical order (e.g. Hyperalic).

2.  If a subqualifier (**optional or additional subqualifier**) related to depth requirements can be constructed by the user, **the figure indicates, which rule applies**: (1), (2), (3), (4), (5). If no figure is indicated, these subqualifiers cannot be constructed.
