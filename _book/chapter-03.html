<p><strong>Diagnostic horizons</strong> are characterized by a combination of attributes that reflect widespread, common results of soil-forming processes. Their features can be observed or measured in the field or the laboratory and require a minimum or maximum expression to qualify as diagnostic. In addition, diagnostic horizons require a certain minimum thickness, thus forming a recognizable layer in the soil.</p>

<p>An albic horizon (from Latin <em>albus</em>, white) is a light-coloured horizon overlying an <em>argic</em>, <em>natric</em>, <em>plinthic</em> or <em>spodic horizon</em> or forming part of a layer with <em>stagnic properties</em>. It has low contents of Fe and Mn (depleted from both oxidized and reduced forms) and of organic matter, and at least one of these substances has previously been present and was lost due to clay migration, podzolization, and/or redox processes caused by water stagnation.</p>

<p>Albic horizons are normally overlain by humus-enriched surface layers but may also be at the mineral soil surface as a result of erosion or artificial removal of the surface layer. Many albic horizons represent a strong expression of eluviation and are therefore called eluvial horizons. In sandy materials, albic horizons can reach considerable thickness, up to several metres, especially in humid tropical regions, and underlying diagnostic horizons may be hard to establish. Albic horizons generally have a weakly expressed soil aggregate structure, a single grain structure or a massive structure. Albic horizons are widely depleted from Fe, both the oxidized and the reduced forms, and typically do not show red colours when applying α,α-dipyridyl solution.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics">Relationships with some other diagnostics</h4>
<p>While the albic horizon is the result of soil-forming processes, the <em>claric material</em> is only defined by colour criteria, and layers with <em>claric material</em> may or may not have undergone soil-forming processes. The definition of the albic horizon uses the <em>argic</em>, <em>natric</em>, <em>plinthic</em> or <em>spodic horizon</em> or the <em>stagnic properties</em> as criterion. The definitions of the <em>spodic horizon</em> and of the <em>retic</em> and <em>stagnic properties</em>, in turn, use the <em>claric material</em> as criterion.</p>
<p>Many albic horizons that were formed by stagnant water do not show active <em>reducing conditions</em>.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-description-2">General description</h4>
<p>An argic horizon (from Latin <em>argilla</em>, white clay) is a subsurface horizon with a distinctly higher clay content than the overlying horizon. The textural differentiation may be caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>an illuvial accumulation of clay mineral</li>
<li>predominant pedogenic formation of clay minerals in the subsoil</li>
<li>destruction of clay minerals in the overlying horizon</li>
<li>selective surface erosion of clay minerals</li>
<li>upward movement of coarser particles due to swelling and shrinking</li>
<li>biological activity, or</li>
<li>a combination of two or more of these different processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Iron (hydr)oxides are often accumulated or formed together with clay minerals, giving the argic horizon a redder hue and/or a higher chroma.</p>
<p>A clay-richer stratum overlain by a clay-poorer stratum may resemble an argic horizon. However, a textural difference due only to a <em>lithic discontinuity</em> does not qualify as an argic horizon. In some soils, we may have both: a clay-poorer stratum overlying a clay-richer stratum and additionally a textural differentiation caused by soil-forming processes.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="field-identification-1">Field identification</h4>
<p>Textural differentiation and the evidence of clay illuviation are the main features of argic horizons. The recognition of clay coatings and clay bridges is explained in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.23).</p>
<p>In shrink-swell soils, clay coatings at soil aggregate surfaces are easily confused with pressure faces (stress cutans). Pressure faces do not differ in colour from the original aggregate and do not occur on coarse fragments and biopore walls.</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-information-1" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-information-1">Additional information</h4>
<p>The illuvial character of an argic horizon can best be established using thin sections. Diagnostic illuvial argic horizons show areas with oriented clay bodies that constitute on average ≥&nbsp;1% of the entire cross-section. Other tests involved are particle-size distribution analysis to determine the increase in clay content over a specified depth, and the fine clay/total clay ratio. In illuvial argic horizons, the fine clay to total clay ratio is larger than in the overlying horizons, due to preferential transport of fine clay particles.</p>
<p>If the soil shows a lithic discontinuity directly over the argic horizon, or if the surface horizon has been removed by erosion, or if a plough layer directly overlies the argic horizon, then the illuvial nature must be clearly established (diagnostic criterion 2.b).</p>
<p>The argic horizon may be subdivided into several lamellae with coarser-textured layers in between.</p>

<p>Argic horizons are normally situated below eluvial horizons i.e.&nbsp;horizons from which clay minerals have been removed, commonly together with oxides and some organic matter. Although initially formed as a subsurface horizon, argic horizons may occur at the mineral soil surface as a result of erosion or removal of the overlying horizons. Afterwards, new sediments may be added.</p>
<p>Some argic horizons fulfil all the diagnostic criteria of the <em>ferralic horizon</em>. Ferralsols must have a <em>ferralic horizon</em> and may have an argic horizon as well, which may or may not overlap with the <em>ferralic horizon</em>; but if an argic horizon is present, it must have in its upper 30&nbsp;cm: &lt;&nbsp;10% water-dispersible clay or a ΔpH (pH<sub>KCl</sub> - pH<sub>water</sub>) ≥&nbsp;0 or ≥&nbsp;1.4% <em>soil organic carbon</em>.</p>
<p>Argic horizons lack the sodium saturation characteristics of the <em>natric horizon</em>.</p>
<p>Argic horizons in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in humid tropical and subtropical regions may occur in association with <em>sombric horizons</em>.</p>

<p>A calcic horizon (from Latin <em>calx</em>, lime) is a horizon in which secondary calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) has accumulated as discontinuous concentrations. The accumulation usually occurs in subsurface layers, or more rarely, in surface horizons. The calcic horizon may contain primary carbonates as well.</p>

<p>Calcium carbonate can be identified in the field using 1&nbsp;<em>M</em> hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution. The degree of effervescence is an indication of its amount (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.4.25).</p>
<p>Secondary carbonates are visible as usually discrete permanent accumulations (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.4.25). In the calcic horizon, they are predominantly non-cemented or less than moderately cemented. However, discontinuous accumulations, which are moderately or more cemented, may also occur.</p>
<p>Other possible indications of a calcic horizon are:</p>
<ul>
<li>white, pinkish to reddish, or grey colours (if not overlapping horizons rich in organic carbon)</li>
<li>a low porosity (interaggregate porosity is usually less than in the horizon directly above, and possibly also less than in the horizon directly below).</li>
</ul>
<p>When sampling, please make sure that the sample includes the accumulations of secondary carbonates in order to obtain the laboratory data for criteria 1 and 2.b.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-information-2">Additional information</h4>
<p>The determination of carbonates in the laboratory (Annex&nbsp;2, Chapter&nbsp;9.9) uses an acid and measures the evolved CO<sub>2</sub>. It may stem from various carbonates, but the carbonate content is calculated as if it were only from calcium carbonate. This is called the <strong>calcium carbonate equivalent</strong>.</p>
<p>Determination of the amount of calcium carbonate (by mass) and the changes of calcium carbonate content within the soil profile are the main analytical criteria for establishing the presence of a calcic horizon. <em>Lithic discontinuities</em> and any change of water permeability may favour the formation of secondary carbonates. Determination of pH<sub>water</sub> enables distinction between accumulations with a basic (<em>calcic</em>) character (pH&nbsp;8-8.7) due to the dominance of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and those with an ultrabasic (<em>non-calcic</em>) character (pH&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;8.7) because of the presence of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and/or MgCO<sub>3</sub>.</p>
<p>In addition, the analysis of thin sections may reveal the presence of calcium carbonate pedofeatures (e.g.&nbsp;nodules, pendents) or evidence of silicate epigenesis (calcite pseudomorphs after primary minerals), besides evidences of removal of carbonates in layers above or below the calcic horizon.</p>
<p>If the accumulation of soft carbonates is such that all or most of the soil structure and/or rock structure disappears and continuous concentrations of calcium carbonate prevail, the Hypercalcic qualifier is used.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-3">Relationships with some other diagnostics</h4>
<p>When calcic horizons become continuously cemented with a cementation class of at least moderately cemented, transition takes place to the <em>petrocalcic horizon</em>, the expression of which may be massive or platy. A calcic horizon and a <em>petrocalcic horizon</em> may overlie each other.</p>
<p>Accumulations of secondary carbonates, not qualifying for a calcic horizon, may fulfil the diagnostic criteria of <em>protocalcic properties</em>, which are fulfilled by most calcic horizons as well. <em>Calcaric material</em> includes primary carbonates.</p>
<p>In dry regions and in the presence of sulfate-bearing soil or groundwater solutions, calcic horizons occur associated with <em>gypsic horizons</em>. Calcic and <em>gypsic horizons</em> typically (but not always) occupy different positions in the soil profile because gypsum is more soluble than calcium carbonate, and they can normally be distinguished clearly from each other by a difference in crystal morphology. Gypsum crystals tend to be needle-shaped, usually visible to the naked eye, whereas pedogenic calcium carbonate crystals are much finer in size.</p>

<p>In many cambic horizons, Fe oxides are formed, which give the horizon a redder hue and a higher chroma. However, if the parent material has much hematite, the formation of goethite in cooler and humid conditions usually makes it yellower.</p>
<p>Dissolution of carbonates or gypsum is a widespread feature of cambic horizons in both humid and semi-arid environments. In many cases, this may be proven by a lesser carbonate or gypsum content compared to the underlying layer. However, in some soils, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, this lesser content is not evident. In these soils, the presence of <em>protocalcic</em> or <em>protogypsic properties</em> in the underlying layer is a proof that carbonates or gypsum have been dissolved in the horizon above. On the other hand, such accumulations may also be caused by ascending groundwater in soils with <em>gleyic properties</em>, and <em>gleyic properties</em> have to be excluded in the underlying layer for this comparison.</p>

<p>The cambic horizon can be considered the predecessor of many other diagnostic horizons, all of which have specific properties that are not or only weakly expressed in the cambic horizon – such as illuvial or residual accumulations, removal of substances other than carbonates or gypsum, accumulation of soluble components, or the development of specific soil structure like wedge-shaped aggregates.</p>
<p>Cambic horizons in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in humid tropical and subtropical regions may occur in association with <em>sombric horizons</em>. The ratio between Fe<sub>ox</sub> and Fe<sub>dith</sub> differentiates the cambic horizon from the <em>tsitelic horizon</em> (higher ratio). The <em>plinthic</em> and the <em>petroplinthic horizon</em> have usually much higher Fe<sub>dith</sub> contents.</p>

<p>A ferralic horizon (from Latin <em>ferrum</em>, iron, and <em>alumen</em>, alum) is a subsurface horizon resulting from long and intense weathering. The clay fraction is dominated by low-activity clays and contains various amounts of resistant minerals such as (hydr-)oxides of Fe, Al, Mn and Ti. There may be a marked residual accumulation of quartz in the silt or sand fractions.</p>

<p>Ferralic horizons are associated with old and stable landforms. The macrostructure is moderate to weak but typical ferralic horizons have a strong microaggregation.</p>
<p>Ferralic horizons rich in Fe oxides (especially rich in hematite) have usually a friable rupture-resistance class, moist. Disrupted dry soil material flows like flour between the fingers. Lumps of ferralic horizons are usually relatively light in mass because of the low bulk density. Many ferralic horizons give a hollow sound when tapped, indicating high porosity. In some ferralic horizons, the high porosity is the result of termite activity. Generally, the voids between the microaggregates provide a high porosity.</p>
<p>If the ferralic horizon has less hematite and a more yellowish colour, it typically shows a higher bulk density and a lower porosity. It is massive or has a weak subangular blocky structure and a firm rupture-resistance class, moist.</p>
<p>Indicators of clay illuviation such as clay coatings are generally absent or rare, as are pressure faces and other stress features. Boundaries of a ferralic horizon are normally gradual to diffuse, and little variation in colour or particle-size distribution within the horizon can be detected.</p>

<p>As an alternative to the weatherable minerals requirement, a total reserve of bases (TRB = exchangeable plus mineral calcium [Ca], magnesium [Mg], potassium [K] and sodium [Na]) of &lt;&nbsp;25&nbsp;cmol<sub>c</sub>&nbsp;kg<sup>-1</sup> soil may be indicative.</p>
<p>Ferralic horizons normally have &lt;&nbsp;10% water-dispersible clay. Occasionally they may have more waterdispersible clay, but if so, they have a ΔpH (pH<sub>KCl</sub> - pH<sub>water</sub>) ≥&nbsp;0 or a relatively high content of organic carbon.</p>
<p>Examples of easily weatherable minerals are all 2:1 phyllosilicates, chlorites, sepiolites, palygorskites, allophanes, 1:1 trioctahedral phyllosilicates (serpentines), feldspars, feldspathoids, ferromagnesian minerals, glass, zeolites, dolomite and apatite. The intent of the term weatherable minerals is to include those minerals that are unstable in humid climates compared with other minerals, such as quartz and 1:1&nbsp;clay minerals, but that are more resistant to weathering than calcite (Soil Survey Staff, 1999).</p>
<p>In thin sections, ferralic horizons have generally an undifferentiated b-fabric due to the isotropic behaviour of Fe oxides. The groundmass has commonly a granular microstructure, with a porosity composed by packing pores and star-like vughs, besides channels and chambers due to a strong bioturbation.</p>

<p>A ferric horizon (from Latin <em>ferrum</em>, iron) has formed by redox processes, usually caused by stagnant water, which may be active or relict, and shows redoximorphic features. The segregation of Fe (or Fe and Mn) has advanced to such an extent that oximorphic features (coarse masses or discrete concretions and/or nodules) have formed inside soil aggregates, and the matrix between them is largely depleted of Fe and Mn. They do not necessarily have enhanced Fe (or Fe and Mn) contents, but Fe (or Fe and Mn) are concentrated in the oximorphic features. Generally, such segregation leads to poor aggregation of the soil particles in Fe- and Mn-depleted zones and a compaction of the horizon. It mainly occurs in old landscapes.</p>

<p>A fragic horizon has a prismatic and/or blocky structure. In some fragic horizons, the soil aggregates have a high bulk density. In others, the inner parts of the aggregates may have a relatively high total porosity but, as a result of a dense outer rim, there is no continuity between the pores within and outside the aggregates. Between the prisms or the angular blocks, a weaker aggregate structure or a massive structure and mostly also a lighter soil colour is found. The result is a closed box system with ≥&nbsp;60% of the soil volume that cannot be explored by roots and is not percolated by water. Possible reasons for the dense outer rim are: clay coatings, swelling and shrinking, or the pressure of the roots growing only vertically.</p>
<p>It is essential that the required soil volume is inspected from both vertical and horizontal sections; horizontal sections often reveal a polygonal pattern. Three or four such polygons (or a cut up to 1&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) are sufficient to test the volumetric basis for the definition of the fragic horizon.</p>
<p>Fragic horizons are commonly loamy, but loamy sand and clay textures are not excluded. In the latter case, the clay mineralogy is dominantly kaolinitic.</p>
<p>The aggregates have commonly a penetration resistance ≥&nbsp;4&nbsp;MPa at field capacity.</p>
<p>The fragic horizon has little faunal activity, except occasionally between the aggregates.</p>

<p>How to recognize secondary gypsum is described in Annex&nbsp;1 (Chapter 8.4.26). The accumulation may be in distinct form or flour-like. The latter gives the gypsic horizon a massive structure.</p>

<p>The recommended procedure to determine gypsum in the laboratory (Annex&nbsp;2, Chapter 9.10) also extracts anhydrite, which is considered to be mainly primary.</p>
<p>Thin section analysis is helpful to establish the presence of secondary gypsum, as individual gypsic pedofeatures or as generalized accumulations in the groundmass.</p>
<p>If the accumulation of gypsum becomes such that all or most of the soil structure and/or rock structure disappears and continuous concentrations of gypsum prevail, the Hypergypsic qualifier is used.</p>

<p>When gypsic horizons become continuously cemented, transition takes place to the <em>petrogypsic horizon</em>, the expression of which may be as massive or platy structures. A gypsic horizon and a <em>petrogypsic horizon</em> may overlie each other. Accumulations of secondary gypsum, not qualifying for a gypsic horizon, may fulfil the diagnostic criteria of <em>protogypsic properties</em>, which are fulfilled by most gypsic horizons as well. <em>Gypsiric material</em> includes primary gypsum.</p>
<p>In dry regions, gypsic horizons may be associated with <em>calcic</em> and/or <em>salic horizons</em>. <em>Calcic</em> and gypsic horizons usually occupy distinct positions in the soil profile as the solubility of calcium carbonate is less than that of gypsum. They can normally be distinguished clearly from each other by the morphology (see <em>calcic horizon</em>). <em>Salic</em> and gypsic horizons also occupy different positions in the profile due to different solubilities.</p>

<p>The colour of many natric horizons ranges from brown to black, especially in the upper part, but lighter colours or yellow to red colours may also be found. The structure is usually coarse columnar or coarse prismatic, in places blocky. Rounded tops of the aggregates are characteristic. In many cases, they are covered by a whitish powder coming from the overlying eluvial horizon.</p>
<p>Both colour and structural characteristics depend on the composition of the exchangeable cations and the soluble salt content in the underlying layers. Often, thick and dark-coloured clay coatings occur, especially in the upper part of the horizon. Many natric horizons have poor soil aggregate stability and very low permeability under wet conditions. When dry, the rupture-resistance class of the natric horizon is at least hard. Soil reaction is commonly strongly alkaline with pH<sub>water</sub> ≥&nbsp;8.5.</p>

<section id="additional-information-10" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-information-10">Additional information</h4>
<p>Another measure to characterize the natric horizon is the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), which is ≥&nbsp;13. The SAR is calculated from soil solution data (Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup> given in mmol<sub>c</sub>/litre): SAR = Na<sup>+</sup>/[(Ca<sup>2+</sup> + Mg<sup>2+</sup>)/2]<sup>0.5</sup>.</p>
<p>In micromorphological studies, natric horizons have a specific fabric. The low structural stability is shown by a pore system with many vesicles and vughs. Pedofeatures consist of layered silt and clay cappings, coatings and infillings; clay intercalations and fragments of clay coatings in the groundmass, due to partial structure collapse.</p>

<p>Frequently, a salt-affected layer occurs below the natric horizon. The salt influence may extend into the natric horizon, which then becomes saline as well. Salts present may be chlorides, sulfates or carbonates/bicarbonates.</p>

<p>A nitic horizon has ≥&nbsp;30% clay but may feel loamy. Little difference in clay content compared to the overlying and the underlying horizon and a gradual or diffuse distinctness of the horizon boundaries are typical. Similarly, there is no abrupt colour difference to the horizons directly above and below. The colours are of low value with a hue often 2.5YR, moist, but sometimes redder or yellower. The structure is moderate to strong blocky, breaking into polyhedral or flat-edged elements showing shiny pressure faces. In addition, clay coatings may be found. Nitic horizons do not show reducing conditions but may show relict oximorphic features, e.g., concretions and nodules of Fe and Mn oxides.</p>

The moderate to low CEC reflects the dominance of 1:1 clay minerals (either kaolinite and/or [meta-]halloysite). Many nitic horizons have a ratio of water-dispersible clay to total clay of &lt;&nbsp;0.1. Through the microscope, the birefringent fabric may be striated.

<p>The nitic horizon may be considered as a strongly expressed <em>cambic horizon</em> with specific properties such as a high amount of oxalate-extractable (active) iron. Nitic horizons may show clay coatings and may satisfy the requirements of an <em>argic horizon</em>, although the clay content in the nitic horizon is not much higher than in the overlying horizon. Its mineralogy (kaolinitic/[meta]halloysitic) sets it apart from most <em>vertic horizons</em>, which have a dominantly smectitic mineralogy and usually occur in climates with a more pronounced dry season. However, nitic horizons may grade laterally into <em>vertic horizons</em> in lower landscape positions. The well-expressed soil structure, the high amount of oxalate-extractable iron, and in some cases, the intermediate CEC in nitic horizons set them apart from <em>ferralic horizons</em>. Nitic horizons strongly differ from <em>cohesic horizons</em>, which may also be rich in clay. Nitic horizons in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in humid tropical and subtropical regions may occur in association with <em>sombric horizons</em>.</p>

The cementing agent differentiates petrocalcic and (<em>petro</em>-)<em>duric horizons</em>. In petrocalcic horizons, calcium and some magnesium carbonate constitute the main cementing agent while some accessory silica may be present. In (<em>petro</em>-)<em>duric horizons</em>, silica is the main cementing agent, with or without calcium carbonate.

<p>A plaggic horizon (from Low German <em>plaggen</em>, sod) is a black or brown mineral surface horizon that results from human activity. Mostly in nutrient-poor soils in the north-western part of Central Europe from Medieval times until the introduction of mineral fertilizers at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, sod and other topsoil materials were commonly used for bedding livestock. The sods consist of grassy, herbaceous or dwarf-shrub vegetation, its root mats and organic and mineral soil sticking to them. The mixture of sods and excrements was later spread on fields. The material brought in eventually produced an appreciably thickened horizon (in places &gt;&nbsp;100&nbsp;cm thick) that is rich in soil organic carbon. Base saturation is typically low.</p>

<p>A pretic horizon (from Portuguese <em>preto</em>, black) is a mineral surface horizon that results from human activities with the addition of black carbon, especially charcoal. It is characterized by its dark colour, usually the presence of artefacts (ceramic fragments, lithic instruments, bone or shell tools etc.) and high contents of organic carbon, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and micronutrients (mainly zinc and manganese), usually contrasting with natural soils in the surrounding area. It contains remnants of black carbon, which may be recognized visually or by chemical analyses.</p>
<p>Pretic horizons are for example widespread in the Amazon Basin, where they are the result of pre-Columbian activities and have persisted over many centuries despite the prevailing humid tropical conditions generally causing high organic matter mineralization rates. These soils with a pretic horizon are known as ‘Terra Preta de Indio’ or ‘Amazonian Dark Earths’. They generally have high organic carbon stocks. Many of them are dominated by low-activity clays.</p>

<p>Wedge-shaped soil aggregates and slickensides (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.4.10 and 8.4.14) may not be immediately evident if the soil is moist. A decision about their presence can sometimes only be made after the soil has dried out. Wedge-shaped aggregates may be a second-level structure of larger angular blocky or prismatic elements, which should be carefully examined to see if wedge-shaped aggregates are present.</p>

<p>Sombric horizons are found in dark-coloured subsoils, in many cases associated with well-drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in humid tropical and subtropical regions.

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-information-19">Additional information</h4>
<p>There are two important theories about the genesis of sombric horizons (de Almeida et al., 2015).</p>
<p>First theory: The higher content of organic matter is illuvial, but neither associated with Al nor with Na. In this case, coatings of organic matter at soil aggregate surfaces and pore walls as well as illuvial organic matter in thin sections are found.</p>
<p>Second theory: The higher content of organic matter is residual. A moister climate and a higher plant biomass (e.g.&nbsp;forest) formed thick A horizons. Afterwards, climate became drier, the upper part of the old A horizon underwent an intense mineralization, while the residues of the current vegetation, poorer in biomass (e.g.&nbsp;savanna), form only a thin A horizon. At greater depth, mineralization is slower, and the lower part of the old A horizon is preserved, especially if climate is cool and base saturation low.</p>

<p>A spodic horizon (from Greek <em>spodos</em>, wood ash) is a subsurface horizon that contains illuvial substances. In most spodic horizons, the appearance of the upper subhorizons is characterized by dark illuvial organic matter and that of the lower subhorizons by intensely coloured illuvial Fe oxides. Some spodic horizons, however, show either little illuviation of Fe or little illuviation of organic matter. In all spodic horizons, illuviated Al can be proven analytically. The illuvial materials are characterized by a high pH-dependent charge, a relatively large surface area and an elevated water retention. An overlying eluvial horizon may intrude with tongues into the spodic horizon.</p>

<p>Many spodic horizons underly <em>claric material</em> and have brownish-black to reddish-brown colours, which often fade downwards. The shape of many spodic horizons is wavy, irregular, or broken. Spodic horizons may be (partially) cemented.

<p>There may be a <em>hortic</em>, <em>plaggic</em>, <em>terric</em> or <em>umbric horizon</em> above the spodic horizon, with or without <em>claric material</em> in between.</p>
<p>Spodic horizons in volcanic materials may exhibit <em>andic properties</em> as well. Spodic horizons in other materials may exhibit some characteristics of the andic properties, but normally have a higher bulk density. For classification purposes, the presence of a spodic horizon, unless buried deeper than 50 cm, is given preference over the occurrence of <em>andic properties</em>.</p>
<p>Some layers with <em>andic properties</em> resemble spodic horizons, if they are covered by relatively young, lightcoloured volcanic ejecta that satisfy the requirements of <em>claric material</em>. There is a <em>lithic discontinuity</em> in between, which excludes them from being spodic horizons. This can be further proven by the following analyses: The uppermost 2.5&nbsp;cm of the spodic horizon have a C<sub>py</sub>/OC and a C<sub>f</sub>/C<sub>py</sub> of ≥&nbsp;0.5. C<sub>py</sub>, C<sub>f</sub> and OC are pyrophosphate-extractable C, fulvic acid C and organic C, respectively (Ito et al., 1991).</p>
<p>Similar to many spodic horizons, <em>sombric horizons</em> also contain more organic matter than an overlying layer. They can be differentiated from each other by the clay mineralogy. Kaolinite usually dominates in <em>sombric horizons</em>, whereas the clay fraction of spodic horizons commonly contains significant amounts of vermiculite and Al-interlayered chlorite.</p>
<p><em>Plinthic horizons</em>, which contain large amounts of accumulated Fe, have less Fe<sub>ox</sub> than spodic horizons.</p>

<p>Vertic horizons are clay-rich and, when dry, often have a rupture-resistance class of at least hard. Polished, shiny surfaces with striations (slickensides), often at sharp angles, are distinctive.</p>
<p>Wedge-shaped soil aggregates and slickensides (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.4.10 and 8.4.14) may not be immediately evident if the soil is moist. A decision about their presence can sometimes only be made after the soil has dried out. Wedge-shaped aggregates may be a second-level structure of larger angular blocky or prismatic elements, which should be carefully examined to see if wedge-shaped aggregates are present.</p>

<p>Andic properties (from Japanese <em>an</em>, dark, and <em>do</em>, soil) result from moderate weathering of mainly pyroclastic deposits.

These minerals and complexes are commonly part of the weathering sequence in pyroclastic deposits (<em>tephric material</em> → <em>vitric properties</em> → andic properties).

<p>Andic properties may be identified using the sodium fluoride field test of Fieldes and Perrott (1966). A pH in NaF of ≥&nbsp;9.5 indicates allophane and/or organo-aluminium complexes in carbonate-free soils. The test is indicative for most layers with andic properties, except for those very rich in organic matter. However, the same reaction occurs in <em>spodic horizons</em> and in certain acid clays that are rich in Al-interlayered clay minerals.</p>
<p>Andic layers may exhibit thixotropy, i.e.&nbsp;the soil material changes, under pressure or by rubbing, from a plastic solid into a liquefied stage and back into the solid condition.</p>
</section>
<section id="additional-information-23" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-information-23">Additional information</h4>
<p>Andic properties may be found at the soil surface or in the subsurface, commonly occurring as layers. Many surface layers with andic properties contain a high amount of organic matter (≥&nbsp;5%), are commonly very dark coloured (Munsell colour value and chroma of ≤&nbsp;3, moist), have a fluffy macrostructure, and in some places show thixotropy. They have a low bulk density and commonly have a silt loam or finer texture. Andic surface layers rich in organic matter may be very thick, having a thickness of ≥&nbsp;50&nbsp;cm in some soils. Andic subsurface layers are generally somewhat lighter coloured.</p>
<p>In perhumid climates, humus-rich andic layers may contain more than twice the water content of samples that have been dried at 105&nbsp;°C and rewetted (hydric characteristic).</p>
<p>For bulk density, the volume is determined after an undried soil sample has been desorbed at 33&nbsp;kPa (no prior drying), and afterwards the weight is determined at 105&nbsp;°C.</p>
<p>Two major types of andic properties are recognized: one in which allophane, imogolite and similar minerals are predominant (Silandic qualifier); and one in which Al complexed by organic acids prevails (Aluandic qualifier). The silandic property typically gives a strongly acid to neutral soil reaction and is a bit lighter coloured, while the aluandic property gives an extremely acid to acid reaction and a blackish colour.</p>
<p>Uncultivated, organic matter-rich surface layers with silandic properties typically have a pHwater of ≥&nbsp;4.5, while uncultivated surface layers with aluandic properties and rich in organic matter typically have a pH<sub>water</sub> of &lt;&nbsp;4.5. Generally, pH<sub>water</sub> in silandic subsoil layers is ≥&nbsp;5.</p>

<p><em>Vitric properties</em> are distinguished from andic properties by a lesser degree of weathering. This is evidenced by the presence of volcanic glasses and usually by a lower amount of short-range-order pedogenic minerals and/or organo-metallic complexes, as characterized by a lower amount of Al<sub>ox</sub> and Fe<sub>ox</sub>, a higher bulk density, or a lower phosphate retention. The diagnostic criteria of the <em>vitric</em> and <em>andic properties</em> are adapted after Shoji et al.&nbsp;(1996), Takahashi et al.&nbsp;(2004) and findings of the COST 622 Action.</p>

<p>Gleyic properties result from a redox gradient between groundwater and the capillary fringe causing an uneven distribution of iron or manganese (hydr-)oxides. In the lower part of the soil and/or inside the soil aggregates, the oxides are either transformed into soluble Fe/Mn(II) compounds or they are translocated; both processes lead to the absence of colours that have a Munsell hue redder than 2.5Y. Translocated Fe and Mn compounds can be concentrated in the oxidized form (Fe[III], Mn[IV]) on soil aggregate surfaces or on biopore walls (rusty root channels), and towards the surface even in the matrix. Mn concentrations can be recognized by strong effervescence using a 10%&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution.</p>
<p>Reductimorphic features reflect permanently wet conditions. In loamy and clayey material, blue-green colours predominate owing to Fe(II, III) hydroxy salts (green rust). If the material is rich in sulfur (S), blackish colours prevail owing to colloidal iron sulfides such as greigite or mackinawite (easily recognized by smell, after applying 1&nbsp;<em>M</em>&nbsp;HCl). In calcareous material, whitish colours are dominant owing to calcite and/or siderite. Sands are usually light grey to white in colour and also often impoverished in Fe and Mn. Bluish-green and black colours are unstable and often oxidize to a reddish brown colour within a few hours of exposure to air. The upper part of a reductimorphic layer may show up to 5% rusty colours, mainly around channels of burrowing animals or plant roots.</p>
<p>Oximorphic features reflect oxidizing conditions, as in the capillary fringe and in the surface horizons of soils with fluctuating groundwater levels. Specific colours indicate ferrihydrite (reddish brown), goethite (bright yellowish brown), lepidocrocite (orange), schwertmannite (dark orange) and jarosite (pale yellow). In loamy and clayey soils, the iron oxides/hydroxides are concentrated on soil aggregate surfaces and the walls of larger pores (e.g.&nbsp;old root channels).</p>
<p>In most cases, a layer fulfilling diagnostic criterion 2 overlies a layer fulfilling criterion 1. Some soils, including underwater soils (freshwater or seawater) and tidal soils have only a layer that fulfils diagnostic criterion 1 and no layer fulfilling criterion 2.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-description-67">General description</h4>
<p>Solimovic material (from Latin <em>solum</em>, soil, and <em>movere</em>, to move) is a heterogeneous mixture of material that has moved downslope, suspended in water. It is dominated by material that underwent soil formation at its original place, e.g.&nbsp;organic matter accumulation or the formation of Fe oxides. It has been transported as a result of erosional wash or soil creep, and the transport may have been accelerated by land-use practices (e.g.&nbsp;deforestation, ploughing, downhill tillage, structure degradation). Solimovic material has been formed in relatively recent times (mostly Holocene). It normally accumulates in slope positions, in depressions or above a barrier on a low-grade slope. The barrier may be natural or human-made (e.g.&nbsp;hedge walls, terraces, benches). After deposition, there was no advanced soil formation.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="field-identification-46">Field identification</h4>
<p>The fine earth of solimovic material can be of any particle size. Some small coarse fragments may be included. Solimovic material is generally imperfectly sorted. It may show some gross stratification, but stratification is not a typical feature due to the diffuse or chaotic nature of the deposition process. Solimovic material tends to occupy gently sloping to moderately steep sloping (2-30%) areas. Black carbon or small <em>artefacts</em> such as pieces of bricks, ceramics and glass may be present in solimovic material. In many cases, solimovic material has a <em>lithic discontinuity</em> at its base.</p>
<p>The upper part of the solimovic material shows characteristics (fine earth texture, colour, pH and <em>soil organic carbon</em> content) similar to the surface layer of the source in the neighbourhood. In extreme cases, the profile in the solimovic material mirrors the eroded soil profile of upward slope positions, with topsoil material buried under former subsoil material. Good indication in a landscape is varying colour of the soil surface between convex and concave positions.</p>

<section id="additional-information-34" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="additional-information-34">Additional information</h4>
<p>Accumulations by rapid mass movements such as in landslides, slumps or tree throws do not meet the set of diagnostic criteria of solimovic material.</p>
<p>In agricultural environments, solimovic material has mostly a high base saturation. If not natural, this is the result of liming or fertilization before and/or after having been eroded.</p>
<p>In former editions of WRB, the solimovic material was called colluvic material. However, the traditional use of the word ‘colluvium’ is so different between countries and national traditions and changed so much over time (Miller &amp; Juilleret, 2020) that it is better to avoid this term and use a new one.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-63">Relationships with some other diagnostics</h4>
<p>Solimovic material is not associated with perennial water bodies (e.g.&nbsp;rivers, lakes, the sea) and can therefore be distinguished from <em>fluvic material</em>. However, in toeslope positions, <em>fluvic</em> and solimovic material may be sedimented alternatingly or grade into each other and may be difficult to differentiate.</p>
<p>Solimovic material is not purposefully added as, e.g., the soil material in <em>terric horizons</em>.</p>
