# Annex 4: Soil description sheet {#sec-a4}

The soil description sheet is provided as an open-access excel file on the [WRB homepage](https://www3.ls.tum.de/boku/wrb-working-group/documents/wrb-2022/soil-description-sheet). For cells coloured in brown, a code is required. For cells coloured in green, figures or free text are required. The excel file representing the whole Annexes 1 ([Chapter 8](annex-01-field-guide.qmd)) and 3 ([Chapter 10](annex-03-horizon-layer-designations.qmd)) is relatively long.

You may also prepare your individual short version. If you are sure that in the area of your soil survey certain characteristics cannot occur, you may delete the respective columns. (Example: If your survey is not in a desert, you may delete the columns referring to desert features.)
