    "text": "The soil is a living, heterogeneous and dynamic system that includes physical, chemical, biological components, and their interactions. Therefore, to assess its quality it is necessary to measure, describe, and classify its properties.\nSoil classification is necessary to predict its behavior and identify limitations that allow us to make correct management decisions in the agricultural, livestock, forestry, urban, environmental, and health fields to name a few of the most important. IUSS soil scientists understood all that and the consequent urgent necessity to create an international soil classification system for name soils and create soil map legends based on a global reference system.\nThat is why the International Union of Soil Sciences in 1980 formed a Working Group to develop the International Reference Base for Soil Classification (IRB), in 1992 renamed the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB), with the proposal of setting forth a soil classification system.\nDuring the 16th World Congress of Soil Science in Montpellier, France, in 1998, the WRB classification was approved and adopted as the international soil correlation and communication system of the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS), and the first edition of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) was presented.\nIn 2022, within the framework of the IUSS “International Decade of Soils 2015-2024” and with the firm commitment to offer to the international community a soil classification system to facilitate both the implementation of soil inventories and the interpretation of soil maps as practical tools for decision-making for geologists, agronomists, farmers, engineers, politicians, etc., the International Union of Soil Sciences presents the fourth edition of the World Reference Base (WRB).\nThe IUSS appreciates the efforts of all those who participate in the WRB working group and make the presentation of this new edition possible as an IUSS edition free to download from the IUSS website.\nLaura Bertha Reyes-Sánchez\nPresident of the International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS)",

    "text": "The first edition of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) was published in 1998, the second in 2006 and the third in 2014. In 2022, at the 22nd World Congress of Soil Science in Glasgow, we present the fourth edition.\nThe fourth edition is the result of another eight years of testing. During international field workshops, we classified numerous soil profiles and developed ideas for improvement. Establishing algorithms for automated classification helped overcome inconsistencies. The 32 Reference Soil Groups were maintained but soil characteristics, not reflected or properly defined up till now in the WRB, had to be taken into account. Many criteria in the diagnostics, the key and in the definitions of the qualifiers were sharpened and refined. Special effort was made to ensure consistency; that the same features are worded in the same way throughout the text, including the annexes.\nThe fourth edition has new annexes:\n\nA new Field Guide, exactly tailored to the needs of WRB, with many definitions of field characteristics, supported by numerous illustrations - it may be used instead of the FAO Guidelines for Soil Description (UN-FAO 2006)\nHorizon and Layer Designations with master symbols and suffixes\nRecommendations for Colour Symbols for Reference Soil Group Maps\nA Soil Description Sheet and a Guidance on Database Set-Up to be provided as separate documents for download.\n\nA large number of soil scientists contributed to the fourth edition (see Acknowledgements). We all hope that the new edition promotes a better understanding of soils, of their distribution and properties, and of their protection and sustainable management.\nThe first three editions of the WRB were published by the FAO in the World Soil Resources Reports series. This was no longer possible. We are glad that the present fourth edition is published by the IUSS.

    "text": "1.1.1 From its beginnings to the third edition 2014/15\nThe World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) is based on the Legend (FAO-UNESCO 1974) and the Revised Legend (FAO-UNESCO-ISRIC 1988) of the Soil Map of the World (FAO-UNESCO 1971–1981). In 1980, the International Society of Soil Science (ISSS, since 2002 the International Union of Soil Sciences, IUSS) formed a Working Group ‘International Reference Base for Soil Classification’ for further elaboration of a science-based international soil classification system. This Working Group was renamed ‘World Reference Base for Soil Resources’ in 1992. The Working Group presented the first edition of the WRB in 1998 (ISSS-ISRIC_FAO 1998), the second edition in 2006 (IUSS Working Group WRB 2006) and the third edition in 2014/15 (IUSS Working Group WRB 2015). In 1998, the ISSS Council endorsed the WRB as its officially recommended terminology to name and classify soils.\nA detailed description of the older WRB history is given in the second edition (IUSS Working Group WRB 2006) and the third edition of the WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB 2015).\n\n\n1.1.2 From the third edition 2014 (Update 2015) to the fourth edition 2022\nThe third edition of the WRB was presented at the 20th World Congress of Soil Science 2014 in Jeju, Korea. In 2015, an Update was published online, which is the valid WRB from 2015 to 2022: https://www.fao.org/3/i3794en/I3794en.pdf.\nThe second edition was translated into several languages: Czech, French, Georgian, Polish, Russian, Slovene, and Spanish.\nSince 2014, several WRB field workshops were organized to test the third edition:\n2014: Ireland\n2017: Latvia and Estonia\n2018: Romania\n2019: Mongolia\n2022: Iceland\nThe field tours associated with the meetings of the IUSS Commission on Soil Classification in South Africa (2016) and Mexico (2022) were additional tests of the third edition and also the tours offered with the 21st World Congress of Soil Science 2018 in Brazil.\nNow, after 8 years, a fourth edition has been prepared.",

    "section": "1.2 Major changes in WRB 2022",
    "text": "1.2 Major changes in WRB 2022\nThe major changes are:\n\nThe contents of the book were rearranged:\n\nThe former Annex 1 (Descriptions) was deleted. The descriptions were not fully up to date.\nAnnex 2 (Laboratory methods) was maintained.\nThe former Annex 3 (Codes) is now Chapter 6. This reflects that the codes, if used, are not only recommended but mandatory.\nThe former Annex 4 is integrated in the new Annex 1.\nThe new Annex 1 is a Field Guide. It replaces the FAO Guidelines (2006). Compared to the FAO Guidelines, the Annex 1 is more comprehensive for WRB, more precise and more didactical using many illustrations. It gives many definitions of field characteristics that up till now have been nowhere defined in WRB, neither in the WRB itself, nor in the FAO Guidelines. Many of these definitions were taken from the USDA Soil Survey Manual (2017) and the NRCS Fieldbook (2012), which brings WRB and Soil Taxonomy closer together.\nThe new Annex 3 provides brief definitions of layer symbols further developing the definitions of the FAO Guidelines.\nThe new Annex 4 explains a soil description sheet that is provided online.\nThe new Annex 5 gives a guidance on database set-up. The details are provided online.\nThe new Annex 6 gives recommendations for colour symbols for Reference Soil Group maps.\n\nIn Chapter 2.1, General rules and definitions, several definitions have been added for WRB: fine earth, whole soil, litter layer, soil surface, mineral soil surface, soil layer, soil horizon. Some new general rules have been added to make the definitions easier.\nAll Reference Soil Groups (RSGs) are maintained. There are some changes in the Key: Planosols and Stagnosols are now before Nitisols and Ferralsols. Fluvisols are before Arenosols.\nThe following diagnostics were deleted:\n\nfulvic horizon, melanic horizon: belonged to an outdated concept of soil organic matter;\naridic properties: had a non-systematic combination of various characteristics (the wind deposition is now characterized by the aeolic material, see below);\ngeric properties: can be better expressed as qualifier;\nsulfidic material: not needed after introducing the hypersulfidic and the hyposulfidic material in 2014.\n\nThe following diagnostics were introduced:\n\nalbic horizon: In the first and the second edition of WRB, the albic horizon was defined. However, it was only defined by colour, and results of soil-forming processes were not required. Therefore, it was changed to albic material in 2014. But this made the definition of the Albic qualifier difficult. Now, the albic horizon was reintroduced, explicitly requiring results of soil-forming processes. The albic material was maintained (just defined by colour) and renamed claric material (see below)\ncohesic horizon: Dense subsurface horizon dominated by kaolinite. It is found in tropical regions with seasonal climate and was not considered so far in WRB.\nlimonic horizon: Accumulation of Fe by capillary rise in groundwater soils. The accumulation is so strong that Fe oxides cause a cementation. It is traditionally referred to as bog iron.\npanpaic horizon: Buried A horizon.\ntsitelic horizon: Accumulation of Fe by subsurface flow, usually from Planosols and Stagnosols further up in the landscape.\nprotogypsic properties: Accumulation of secondary gypsum, not sufficient for a gypsic or petrogypsic horizon.\naeolic material: Deposited by wind.\nmulmic material: Mineral material with a high content of soil organic carbon, derived from organic material. Drainage of organic material causes accelerated decomposition, and eventually the content of soil organic carbon sinks below 20%, which transforms the organic material into mineral material.\norganotechnic material: Contains large amounts of organic artefacts and relatively small contents of soil organic carbon in the fine earth.\n\nThe following diagnostic materials received new names:\n\nclaric material instead of albic material: After reintroducing the albic horizon, it had to be avoided that a diagnostic material and a diagnostic horizon have the same name. The albic material was therefore renamed in claric material.\nsolimovic material instead of colluvic material: The word colluvium has very different meanings in different countries. To avoid confusion, the new name solimovic material was coined. It explains that at least parts of the accumulated material underwent soil formation before having been transported.\n\nMany criteria in the diagnostics, the key and in the definitions of the qualifiers were sharpened and refined. Special effort was undertaken to make sure that the same features are worded in the same way throughout the text, including the annexes.\nSome new qualifiers were defined, some existing ones were deleted, and many definitions have been refined.",

    "section": "1.3 The object classified in the WRB",
    "text": "1.3 The object classified in the WRB\nLike many common words, ‘soil’ has several meanings. In its traditional meaning, soil is the natural medium for the growth of plants, whether or not it has discernible soil horizons (Soil Survey Staff 1999).\nIn the 1998 WRB, soil was defined as:\n\n“… a continuous natural body which has three spatial and one temporal dimension. The three main features governing soil are:\n\nIt is formed by mineral and organic constituents and includes solid, liquid and gaseous phases.\nThe constituents are organized in structures, specific for the pedological medium. These structures form the morphological aspect of the soil cover, equivalent to the anatomy of a living being. They result from the history of the soil cover and from its actual dynamics and properties. Study of the structures of the soil cover facilitates perception of the physical, chemical and biological properties; it permits understanding the past and present of the soil and predicting its future.\nThe soil is in constant evolution, thus giving the soil its fourth dimension, time.”\n\n\nAlthough there are good arguments to limit soil survey and mapping to identifiable stable soil areas with a certain thickness, the WRB has taken the more comprehensive approach to name any object forming part of the epiderm of the earth (Sokolov 1997; Nachtergaele 2005). This approach has a number of advantages; notably that it allows for addressing environmental problems in a systematic and holistic way and avoids sterile discussion on a universally agreed definition of soil and its required thickness and stability. Therefore, the object classified in the WRB is: any material within 2 m of the Earth’s surface that is in contact with the atmosphere, excluding living organisms, areas with continuous ice not covered by other material, and water bodies deeper than 2 m. If explicitly stated, the object classified in the WRB includes layers deeper than 2 m. In tidal areas, the depth of 2 m is to be applied at mean low water springs.\nThe definition includes continuous rock, paved urban soils, soils of industrial areas, soils on buildings and other (permanent/stable) constructions, cave soils as well as subaqueous soils. Soils under continuous rock, except those that occur in caves, are generally not considered for classification, but in special cases, the WRB may be even used to classify soils under rock, for example for palaeopedological reconstruction of the environment. The use of WRB for paleosols is still in an experimental stage.",

    "section": "1.4 Basic principles",
    "text": "1.4 Basic principles\n\nGeneral principles\n\nThe classification of soils is based on soil properties defined in terms of diagnostic horizons, diagnostic properties and diagnostic materials (together called the diagnostics), which to the greatest extent possible should be measurable and observable in the field. Table 1.1 provides an overview of the diagnostics used in the WRB.\nThe selection of diagnostic characteristics takes into account their relationship with soil-forming processes. An understanding of soil-forming processes contributes to a better characterization of soils but these processes should not, as such, be used as differentiating criteria.\nTo the extent possible at a high level of generalization, diagnostic features that are of significance for soil management are selected.\nClimate parameters are not applied in the classification of soils. It is understood that they should be used for interpretation purposes, in combination with soil properties, but they should not form part of soil definitions. The classification of soils is therefore not subordinated to the availability of climate data. The name of a certain soil will not become obsolete due to global or local climate change.\nThe WRB is a comprehensive classification system that enables accommodation of national soil classification systems.\nThe WRB is not intended to be a substitute for national soil classification systems, but rather to serve as a common denominator for communication at the international level.\nThe WRB comprises two levels of categorical detail:\n\nthe First Level having 32 Reference Soil Groups (RSGs);\nthe Second Level, consisting of the name of the RSG combined with a set of principal and supplementary qualifiers.\n\nMany RSGs in the WRB are representative of major soil regions so as to provide a comprehensive overview of the world’s soil cover.\nDefinitions and descriptions reflect variations in soil characteristics that occur both vertically and laterally in the landscape.\nThe term Reference Base is connotative of the common denominator function of the WRB: its units (RSGs) have sufficient width to facilitate harmonization and correlation with national systems.\nIn addition to serving as a correlation between existing classification systems, the WRB also serves as a communication tool for compiling global soil databases and for the inventory and monitoring of the world’s soil resources.\nThe nomenclature used to distinguish soil groups retains terms that have been used traditionally or that can be introduced easily into common language. They are defined precisely, in order to avoid the confusion that occurs where names are used with different connotations.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: The diagnostic horizons, properties and materials of the WRB.

The principal qualifiers are given in a priority sequence. The broad principles that govern the WRB class differentiation are:\n\nAt the First Level (RSGs), classes are differentiated mainly according to characteristic soil features produced by primary pedogenic process, except where special soil parent materials are of overriding importance.\nAt the Second Level (RSGs with qualifiers), soils are differentiated according to soil features resulting from any secondary soil-forming process that has significantly affected the primary characteristics. In many cases, soil characteristics that have a significant effect on land use are taken into account.\n\n\n\n1.4.2 Evolution of the system\nThe Revised Legend of the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World (FAO-UNESCO-ISRIC 1988) was used as a basis for the development of the WRB in order to take advantage of the international soil correlation that had already been conducted through this project and elsewhere. The first edition of the WRB, published in 1998, comprised 30 RSGs; the following editions have 32 RSGs.",

    "text": "1.5 Architecture\nThe WRB comprises two levels of categorical detail:\n\nthe First Level having 32 Reference Soil Groups (RSGs);\nthe Second Level, consisting of the name of the RSG combined with a set of principal and supplementary qualifiers.\n\n\n1.5.1 First Level: The Reference Soil Groups\nTable 1.2 provides an overview of the RSGs and the rationale for the sequence of the RSGs in the WRB Key. The RSGs are allocated to groups on the basis of dominant identifiers, i.e. the soil-forming factors or processes that most clearly condition the soil.\n\n\n1.5.2 Second Level: The Reference Soil Groups with their qualifiers\nIn the WRB, a distinction is made between principal qualifiers and supplementary qualifiers. Principal qualifiers are regarded as being most significant for a further characterization of soils of the particular RSG. They are given in a ranked order. Supplementary qualifiers give some further details about the soil. They are not ranked but listed alphabetically (exception: the supplementary qualifiers related to the texture are given first). Chapter 2 gives the rules for the use of qualifiers for naming soils and for creating map legends. Constructing the second level by adding qualifiers to the RSG has several advantages compared with a dichotomous key:\n\nEvery soil receives the appropriate number of qualifiers. Soils with few characteristics have short names; soils with many characteristics (e.g. polygenetic soils) have longer names.\nThe WRB is capable of indicating most of the soil’s properties, which are incorporated into an informative soil name.\nThe system is robust. Missing data do not necessarily lead to a dramatic error in the classification of a soil. If one qualifier is erroneously added or erroneously omitted based on incomplete data, the rest of the soil name remains correct.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.2: Simplified guide to the WRB Reference Soil Groups (RSGs) with suggested codes.

    "text": "All data refer to the fine earth, unless stated otherwise. The fine earth comprises the soil constituents ≤ 2 mm. The whole soil comprises fine earth, coarse fragments, artefacts, cemented parts and dead plant residues of any size.\nAll data are given by mass (dried at 105° C, see Annex 2, Chapter 9.2), unless stated otherwise.\nA litter layer is a loose layer that contains &gt; 90% (by volume, related to the fine earth plus all dead plant residues) recognizable dead plant tissues (e.g. undecomposed leaves). Dead plant material still connected to living plants (e.g. dead parts of Sphagnum mosses) is not regarded to form part of a litter layer. The soil surface (0 cm) is by convention the surface of the soil after removing, if present, the litter layer and, if present, below a layer of living plants (e.g. living mosses). The mineral soil surface is the upper limit of the uppermost layer consisting of mineral material (see Chapter 3.3.11 and Annex 1, Chapter 8.3.1).\nA soil layer is a zone in the soil, approximately parallel to the soil surface, with properties different from layers above and/or below it. If at least one of these properties is the result of soil-forming processes, the layer is called a soil horizon. In the diagnostic criteria, the term ‘horizon’ is mainly used for the defined diagnostic horizons. The other layers are mainly called ‘layer’ to make sure that the criteria apply, even if they were not regarded to be soil horizons.\nIf a criterion is worded as a conditional clause (if…) and the condition (if-clause) is not true, the criterion is ignored.\nNumerical values obtained in the field or in the laboratory have to be taken as such and must not be rounded when compared with the threshold values in the diagnostic criteria.\nThe diagnostic criteria must be fulfilled throughout the specified depth range, unless stated otherwise. If a diagnostic horizon consists of several subhorizons, the diagnostic criteria (except thickness) must be fulfilled in every subhorizon separately (averages are not calculated), unless stated otherwise.\nThe term limiting layer used in definitions comprises continuous rock, technic hard material, petrocalcic, petroduric, petrogypsic and petroplinthic horizons and other cemented layers with both of the following: cementation with a class of at least moderately cemented and a continuity to the extent that vertical fractures, if present, have an average horizontal spacing of ≥ 10 cm and occupy &lt; 20% (by volume, related to the whole soil).\nOn a slope, the soil is described as a vertical profile. The thickness and depth values are calculated by multiplying the vertically measured values by the cosine of the inclination angle (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.1.2) (Prietzel and Wiesmeier 2019). This is especially important on steep slopes.\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Step one – detecting diagnostic horizons, properties and materials (for short: diagnostics)\nDescribe the soil applying the Field Guide in Annex 1 (Chapter 8). It is useful that you already in the field compile a list of the possible diagnostic horizons, properties and materials observed (see Chapter 3). Conduct the relevant analyses according to Annex 2 (Chapter 9). Then, decide on the presence of diagnostics. For the decision, only the diagnostic criteria are relevant - neither the name of the diagnostic, nor any other description. A layer may fulfil the criteria of more than one diagnostic horizon, property or material, which are then regarded as overlapping or coinciding.\n\n\n2.1.2 Step two – allocating the soil to a Reference Soil Group\nFor the first level of the WRB classification, the described combination of diagnostic horizons, properties and materials and/or additional characteristics are compared to the WRB Key (Chapter 4) in order to allocate the soil to the appropriate Reference Soil Group (RSG). The user must go through the Key systematically, starting at the beginning and excluding one by one all RSGs for which the specified requirements are not met. The soil belongs to the first RSG for which it fulfils the criteria.\n\n\n2.1.3 Step three – allocating the qualifiers\nFor the second level of the WRB classification, qualifiers are used. The qualifiers available for use with a particular RSG are listed in the Key, along with the RSG. They are divided into principal and supplementary qualifiers.\nThe principal qualifiers are ranked and given in an order of importance. The rank of the principal qualifiers reflects particular soil characteristics or properties strongly influencing the soil’s functionality:\nExamples of principal qualifiers indicating subdivisions of the RSG based on soil characteristics:\n\nVitric, Aluandic and Silandic for Andosols\nCarbic and Rustic for Podzols\nanthropogenic horizons: Anthraquic, Hortic, Hydragric, Irragric, Plaggic, Pretic, Terric. These soils have distinct physico-chemical characteristics reflecting their formation.\n\nExamples of subdivisions reflecting major functional restrictions (many of them indicate a deviation from the central image of the RSG): Abruptic, Fragic, Gleyic, Leptic, Petrocalcic, Petroduric, Petrogypsic, Petroplinthic, Retic, Skeletic, Stagnic, Thionic.\nThe supplementary qualifiers are not ranked. Supplementary qualifiers related to the texture, if applicable, are the first in the list. If several ones apply (see Chapter 2.3) they are placed in the sequence from the top to the bottom of the soil profile (e.g. Episiltic, Katoloamic). All other supplementary qualifiers follow them and are used in alphabetical order.\nQualifiers may be principal for some RSGs and supplementary for others, e.g., Turbic is principal for Cryosols and supplementary for other RSGs.\nThe principal qualifiers are added before the name of the RSG without brackets and without commas. The sequence is from right to left, i.e. the uppermost qualifier in the list is placed closest to the name of the RSG. The supplementary qualifiers are added in brackets after the name of the RSG and are separated from each other by commas. The sequence is from left to right, i.e. the first qualifier in the list is placed closest to the name of the RSG.\nIf two or more qualifiers in the list are separated by a slash (/), they are either mutually exclusive (e.g. Dystric and Eutric) or one of them is redundant (see below) with the redundant qualifier(s) listed after the slash(es). In the soil name, supplementary qualifiers are placed in the order of the alphabet (exception: supplementary qualifiers related to the texture, see above), even if their position in the list differs from the alphabetical sequence due to the use of the slash.\nQualifiers that are mutually exclusive may apply to the same soil at different depths. In this case, they can be used both, each one with the respective specifier (see Chapter 2.3). If no specifier is used, only the first applicable qualifier can be used.\nQualifiers conveying redundant information are not added. This is a general rule and applies even if the slash is not used. For example, Eutric is not added if the Calcaric qualifier applies.\nIf qualifiers apply but are not in the list for the particular RSG, they should be added last as supplementary qualifiers. This is mainly relevant for polygenetic soils.\nThe names of the RSGs and the (sub)qualifiers must start with a capital letter.",

The clay-poor upper soil is subdivided into a darker upper and a light-coloured lower horizon.

They further detect the texture class of silty clay loam with 30% clay (Loamic qualifier) from 0 - 60 cm (Ano- specifier) and of silty clay with 45% clay (Clayic qualifier) from 60 - 100 cm (Endo- specifier).

    "text": "2.3 Subqualifiers\nQualifiers may be combined with specifiers (e.g. Epi-, Proto-) to form subqualifiers (e.g. Epiarenic, Protocalcic). Depending on the specifier, the subqualifier fulfils all the criteria of the respective qualifier, or it deviates in a defined way from its set of criteria. The following rules apply:\n\nIf a subqualifier applies that fulfils all the criteria of the qualifier, the subqualifier can - but does not have to - be used instead of its qualifier (optional subqualifiers).\nIf a subqualifier applies that fulfils all the criteria of the qualifier except thickness and/or depth criteria, the subqualifier can - but does not have to - be used, but not the qualifier (additional subqualifiers). Note: It may happen that the qualifier is not listed with the available qualifiers for the respective RSG in Chapter 4.\nIf a subqualifier applies that deviates in a defined way from the set of criteria of the qualifier, the subqualifier must be used instead of the qualifier that is listed as available for the respective RSG in Chapter 4 (mandatory subqualifiers). This is the case for some subqualifiers with a given definition (see below).\n\nOptional and additional subqualifiers are recommended especially for naming soils. Their use is not recommended for principal qualifiers in map units or wherever generalization is important.\nThe use of specifiers does not change the position of the qualifier in the soil name with the exception of the specifiers Bathy-, Thapto-, and Proto- (see below). Those supplementary qualifiers that are added according to the alphabet follow the alphabetical order of the qualifier, not the subqualifier.\nSome subqualifiers can be constructed by the user according to certain rules (see Chapter 2.3.1). Other subqualifiers have a fixed definition given in Chapter 5 (see Chapter 2.3.2).\n\n2.3.1 Subqualifiers constructed by the users\n\nConstructed subqualifiers related to depth requirements\nQualifiers that have depth requirements can be combined with the specifiers Epi-, Endo-, Amphi-, Ano-, Kato-, Poly-, Panto- and Bathy- to create subqualifiers (e.g. Epicalcic, Endocalcic) further expressing the depth of occurrence. Qualifiers that are mutually exclusive at the same depth may be applicable at different depths in the same soil. Qualifiers that already have a depth range requirement of 0-50 cm or 50-100 cm of the soil surface do not require these extra depth specifiers. For every qualifier with depth requirements, the definition (Chapter 5) specifies whether the depth requirement refers to the soil surface or to the mineral soil surface. Subqualifiers related to depth requirements are only used if the relevant soil characteristics are reported until ≥ 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or to a limiting layer, whichever is shallower, or if the non-reported depth range does not influence the correctness of the subqualifier. (Example: A soil is described until 90 cm from the mineral soil surface. It has 0% coarse fragments from 0 - 50 cm and 60% from 50 - 90 cm from the mineral soil surface. The Skeletic qualifier does not apply, but one can use the Endoskeletic subqualifier, because Endoskeletic applies regardless of the amount of coarse fragments from 90 - 100 cm.)\nDepending on the particular qualifier and the particular soil characteristics, depth-related subqualifiers are used in the following different ways:\n\nIf a qualifier refers to a characteristic that occurs at a specific point of depth (e.g. Raptic), optional subqualifiers can be constructed with the following specifiers:\n\nEpi- (from Greek epi, over): the characteristic is present somewhere ≤ 50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface and is absent &gt; 50 and ≤ 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface; if a limiting layer starts ≤ 50 cm from the mineral soil surface, the qualifier referring to the limiting layer receives the Epi- specifier and all other qualifiers remain without specifier.\nEndo- (from Greek endon, inside): the characteristic is present somewhere &gt; 50 of the (mineral) soil surface and is absent ≤ 50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface. (Examples: Endoraptic: the lithic discontinuity is present &gt; 50 and ≤ 100 cm from the mineral soil surface; Endocryic: the cryic horizon has its upper limit &gt; 50 and ≤ 200 cm from the soil surface.)\nAmphi- (from Greek amphi, around): the characteristic is present two or more times: once or more times somewhere ≤ 50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface and once or more times somewhere &gt; 50 and ≤ 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface.\n\nIf a qualifier refers to a layer (e.g. Calcic, Arenic, Fluvic), optional subqualifiers can be constructed with the following specifiers (see Figure 2.1):\n\nEpi- (from Greek epi, over): the layer has its lower limit ≤ 50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface; and no such layer occurs between 50 and 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface; not used if the definition of the qualifier or of the horizon requires that the layer starts at the (mineral) soil surface; if a limiting layer starts ≤ 50 cm from the mineral soil surface, the qualifier referring to the limiting layer receives the Epi- specifier and all other qualifiers remain without specifier.\nEndo- (from Greek endon, inside): the layer starts ≥ 50 cm from the (mineral) soil surface; and no such layer occurs &lt; 50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface. (Examples: Endocalcic: the calcic horizon starts ≥ 50 and ≤ 100 cm from the mineral soil surface; Endospodic: the spodic horizon starts ≥ 50 and ≤ 200 cm from the mineral soil surface.)\nAmphi- (from Greek amphi, around): the layer starts &gt; 0 and &lt; 50 cm from the (mineral) soil surface and has its lower limit &gt; 50 and &lt; 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface; and no such layer occurs &lt; 1 cm of the (mineral) soil surface; and no such layer occurs between 99 and 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or directly above a limiting layer.\nAno- (from Greek ano, upwards): the layer starts at the (mineral) soil surface and has its lower limit &gt; 50 and &lt; 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface; and no such layer occurs between 99 and 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or directly above a limiting layer.\nKato- (from Greek kato, downwards): the layer starts &gt; 0 and &lt; 50 cm from the (mineral) soil surface and has its lower limit ≥ 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or at a limiting layer starting &gt; 50 cm from the (mineral) soil surface; and no such layer occurs &lt; 1 cm of the (mineral) soil surface.\nPoly- (from Greek polys, many):\n\ndiagnostic horizons: two or more diagnostic horizons are present at the depth required by the qualifier definition, interrupted by layers that do not fulfil the criteria of the respective diagnostic horizon;\nother layers: two or more layers within 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface fulfil the criteria of the qualifier, interrupted by layers that do not fulfil the criteria of the respective qualifier; and the thickness criterion is fulfilled by the sum of the thicknesses of the layers; it may or may not be fulfilled by the single layers.\n\nPanto- (from Greek pan, all): the layer starts at the (mineral) soil surface and has its lower limit ≥ 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or at a limiting layer starting &gt; 50 cm from the (mineral) soil surface.\n\n\nQualifiers that are mutually exclusive may occur in the same soil at different depths. In this case, they can be used both, each one with the respective specifier. If the specifiers are used with principal qualifiers, the qualifier referring to the upper layer is placed closer to the name of the RSG. If the specifiers are used with supplementary qualifiers related to the texture, the qualifiers are placed in the sequence from the top to the bottom of the profile. The sequence of the other supplementary qualifiers is according to the alphabetical position of the qualifier, not the subqualifier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Specifiers to construct optional subqualifiers related to depth requirements and referring to a particular layer (Bathy- and Poly- not illustrated, hatching and colours just for better readability), modified by S. Dondeyne\n\n\n\n\nIf a qualifier refers to the major part of a certain depth range or to half or more of a certain depth range (Dystric and Eutric, only), additional subqualifiers can be constructed with the following specifiers:\n\nEpi- (from Greek epi, over): the characteristic is present in the major part (or half or more of the part) between the specified upper limit and 50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface and is absent in the major part (or half or more of the part) between the specified upper limit and 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or between the specified upper limit and a limiting layer starting &gt; 50 cm from the mineral soil surface, whichever is shallower.\nEndo- (from Greek endon, inside): the characteristic is present in the major part (or half or more of the part) between 50 and 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or between 50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface and a limiting layer, whichever is shallower, and is absent in the major part (or half or more of the part) between the specified upper limit and 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or between the specified upper limit and a limiting layer, whichever is shallower.\n\n\nThese additional subqualifiers are only allowed together with the predominant qualifier. If it is a principal qualifier, the predominant qualifier stands closer to the name of the RSG (Epidystic Eutric, Endodystric Eutric, Epieutric Dystric, Endoeutric Dystric). If it is a supplementary qualifier, the alphabetical sequence of the qualifiers is followed.\n\nIf a qualifier refers to a specified depth range throughout (Relocatic, only), additional subqualifiers can be constructed with the following specifiers:\n\nEpi- (from Greek epi, over): the characteristic is present throughout between the (mineral) soil surface and 50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface and is absent in some layer between 50 and 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface.\nEndo- (not applicable).\n\nIf a qualifier refers to a percentage (e.g. Skeletic), additional subqualifiers can be constructed with the following specifiers (no subqualifier if a limiting layer starts &lt; 60 cm from the mineral soil surface):\n\nEpi- (from Greek epi, over): the characteristic is present between the (mineral) soil surface and 50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface but is not present throughout, i.e., if averaged over a depth of 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or between the (mineral) soil surface and a limiting layer, whichever is shallower.\nEndo- (from Greek endon, inside): the characteristic is present between 50 and 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or between 50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface and a limiting layer, whichever is shallower, but is not present throughout, i.e., if averaged over a depth of 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface or between the (mineral) soil surface and a limiting layer, whichever is shallower.\n\nIf a qualifier refers to a specific point of depth or to a layer, but its criteria are only fulfilled if layers at a depth of &gt; 100 cm of the (mineral) soil surface are taken into account, the Bathy- (from Greek bathys, deep) specifier can be used to construct additional subqualifiers. The Bathy- subqualifier extends to a greater depth than specified for the qualifier. If the Endo- specifier cannot be added to a qualifier, the Bathy- specifier cannot be used either (e.g. Alcalic: neither Endo-, nor Bathy-). If used with a principal qualifier, the Bathy- subqualifier must shift to the supplementary qualifiers and be placed within the list of the supplementary qualifiers according to the alphabetical position of the qualifier, not the subqualifier. With the Bathy- specifier, qualifiers that are not even in the list for the particular RSG (see Chapter 4) can be added, for example Eutric Arenosol (Bathylixic). If it comprises buried layers, Bathy- is only allowed in combination with the Thapto- specifier, e.g. Thaptobathyvertic (see the Thapto- specifier, below, and Chapter 2.4.\n\nNote: Specifiers conveying redundant information are not added. For example: Skeletic Epileptic Cambisol, not: Episkeletic Epileptic Cambisol.\n\n\nConstructed subqualifiers related to other requirements\nIf a diagnostic horizon or a layer with a diagnostic property belongs to a buried soil (see Chapter 2.4), the Thapto- (from Greek thaptein, to bury) specifier can be used to construct optional or additional subqualifiers. If used with a principal qualifier, the Thapto- subqualifier must shift to the supplementary qualifiers and be placed within the list of the supplementary qualifiers according to the alphabetical position of the qualifier, not the subqualifier.\nFor soils with a limiting layer, a geomembrane or a continuous layer of artefacts, additional subqualifiers with the Supra- (from Latin supra, above) specifier can be constructed to describe the soil material above, if the thickness or depth requirements of a qualifier or of its respective diagnostics are not fulfilled, but all other criteria are fulfilled throughout in the soil material above (e.g. Ekranic Technosol (Suprafolic)).\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Subqualifiers with a given definition\nFor some qualifiers, subqualifiers are defined in Chapter 5, e.g., Hypersalic and Protosalic for the Salic qualifier. These subqualifiers are not listed with the RSGs in Chapter 4 (unless the qualifier without specifier cannot exist for the respective RSG). They belong to the optional (e.g. Hypercalcic, Orthomineralic), the additional (e.g. Akromineralic) or the mandatory (e.g. Protocalcic) subqualifiers. If the Proto- specifier is used with a principal qualifier, the Proto- subqualifier must shift to the supplementary qualifiers and be placed within the list of the supplementary qualifiers according to the alphabetical position of the qualifier, not the subqualifier.\nIf of one qualifier, two or more subqualifiers with a given definition apply (e.g. Anthromollic and Tonguimollic), they have to be listed all. Adding a further specifier to a subqualifier with a given definition is also allowed, e.g., Endoprotosalic, Supraprotosodic.",

    "text": "2.4 Buried soils\nA buried soil is a soil covered by younger deposits. Where a soil is buried, the following rules apply:\n\nThe overlying material and the buried soil are classified as one soil if both together qualify as a Histosol, Anthrosol, Technosol, Cryosol, Leptosol, Vertisol, Gleysol, Andosol, Planosol, Stagnosol, Fluvisol, Arenosol, or Regosol.\nOtherwise, the overlying material is classified with preference if it is ≥ 50 cm thick or if the overlying material, if it stood alone, satisfies the requirements of a RSG other than a Regosol. For depth requirements in the overlying material, the lower limit of the overlying material is regarded as if it were the upper limit of continuous rock.\nIn all other cases, the buried soil is classified with preference. For depth requirements in the buried soil, the upper limit of the buried soil is regarded as its soil surface.\nIf the overlying soil is classified with preference, there are two options to consider the underlying soil:\n\nIf the underlying soil is not a Regosol or Leptosol and shows a complete horizon sequence, including clearly identifiable organic surface layers and/or mineral topsoil horizons, and one soil does not influence the pedogenic processes in the other soil, respectively (e.g. no clay migration from the overlying into the underlying soil, no Fe transport by capillary upward movement from the underlying into the overlying soil), then the name of the buried soil is placed after the name of the overlying soil adding the word ‘over’ in between, e.g. Skeletic Umbrisol (Siltic) over Albic Podzol (Arenic). As many buried soils are polygenetic, qualifiers that are not in the list for the particular RSG may be applicable. If so, these qualifiers must be used as supplementary qualifiers. The qualifiers Infraandic and Infraspodic are provided for buried soils only and are therefore not listed with the RSGs in Chapter 4. As all non-listed qualifiers, they are added as last supplementary qualifiers.\nOtherwise, a buried diagnostic horizon or a buried layer with a diagnostic property is added with the Thapto- subqualifier to the name of the overlying soil (see Chapter 2.3).\n\nIf the buried soil is classified with preference, the overlying material is indicated with the Novic qualifier. If applicable, the Novic qualifier is combined with certain other qualifiers in the following way (codes in brackets); thickness and depth criteria of these qualifiers do not need to be fulfilled:\nAeoli-Novic (nva)\nFluvi-Novic (nvf)\nSolimovi-Novic (nvs)\nTechni-Novic (nvt)\nTephri-Novic (nvv)\nTransporti-Novic. (nvp)\nIn addition, according to Chapter 5, the texture may also be added, e.g., Aeoli-Siltinovic (sja).",

    "text": "2.5 Guidelines for creating legends for soil maps\nThe following guidelines apply:\n\nA map unit consists of\n\na dominant soil only\na dominant soil plus a codominant soil and/or one or more associated soils\ntwo or three codominant soils\ntwo or three codominant soils plus one or more associated soils.\n\nDominant soils represent ≥ 50% of the soil cover, codominant soils ≥ 25 and &lt; 50% of the soil cover. Associated soils represent ≥ 5 and &lt; 25% of the soil cover or are of high relevance in the landscape. Further soils should be ignored in the denomination of the map unit.\n\nIf codominant or associated soils are indicated, the words ‘dominant:’, ‘codominant:’ and ‘associated:’ are written before the name of the soil; the soils are separated by semicolons.\n\nThe number of qualifiers specified below refers to the dominant soil. For codominant or associated soils, fewer numbers of qualifiers (or even no qualifier) may be appropriate.\nDepending on scale, different numbers of principal qualifiers are used:\n\nFor very small map scales, only the Reference Soil Group (RSG) is used.\nFor next larger map scales, the RSG plus the first applicable principal qualifier are used.\nFor next larger map scales, the RSG plus the first two applicable principal qualifiers are used.\n\nIt is not possible to give general figures for these scales, because this depends very much on the homogeneity or heterogeneity of the landscape. In landscapes of intermediate homogeneity, very small scales would be smaller than 1 :  10 000 000, the next larger scales smaller than 1 : 5 000 000 and the next larger scales smaller than 1 : 1 000 000.\n\nIf there are fewer qualifiers applicable than described above, the lesser number is used.\nDepending on the purpose of the map or according to national traditions, at any scale level, further qualifiers may be added as elective qualifiers. These may be principal qualifiers from further down the list and not already used in the soil name, or they may be supplementary qualifiers. They are placed using the above-mentioned rules for supplementary qualifiers. If two or more elective qualifiers are used, the following rules apply:\n\nthe principal qualifiers are placed first, and of them, the first applicable qualifier is placed first, and\nthe sequence of any supplementary qualifiers added is decided by the soil scientist who makes the map.\n\n\n\nExample for creating a map unit in WRB\nA landscape usually shows a variety of soils. For a map unit, they often have to be combined. The principles are shown in Figure 2.2 and in Table 2.1 and Table 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Soils in a landscape that need to be combined to form a map unit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Detection of dominant, codominant and associated soils.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea\nComplete soil name\nResult\n\n\n\n\n1\nHaplic Luvisol (Episiltic, Katoclayic, Aric, Cutanic, Differentic, Epic, Ochric)\ndominant soil\n\n\n2\nEutric Stagnic Leptic Cambisol (Loamic, Humic)\ncodominant soil\n\n\n3\nAlbic Stagnic Luvisol (Anosiltic, Endoclayic, Cutanic, Differentic, Endic, Humic)\nassociated soil\n\n\n4\nThyric Technosol (Loamic, Calcaric, Skeletic)\nignored\n\n\n5\nEutric Luvic Stagnosol (Episiltic, Katoclayic, Humic)\nignored\n\n\n6\nHortic Anthrosol (Loamic, Eutric)\nignored\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Denomination of the map unit depending on the scale level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap scale level\nDominant soil\nCodominant soil\nAssociated soil\n\n\n\n\nFirst\nLuvisols\nCambisols\n\n\n\n\nSecond\nHaplic Luvisols\nLeptic Cambisols\nStagnic Luvisols\n\n\nThird\nHaplic Luvisols\nStagnic Leptic Cambisols\nAlbic Stagnic Luvisols\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples for map units in WRB\n\nExample 1\nA map unit dominated by a soil with a very dark mineral surface horizon, 30 cm thick, with high base saturation, no secondary carbonates and groundwater influence starting at 60 cm from the mineral soil surface (i.e. having a layer, ≥ 25 cm thick, that has gleyic properties throughout and reducing conditions in some parts of every sublayer), will be named as follows:\n\nat the first map scale level: Phaeozems\nat the second map scale level: Chernic Phaeozems\nat the third map scale level: Gleyic Chernic Phaeozems\n\n\n\nExample 2\nIn a map unit, no diagnostics apply. In 80% of the area, the soil has &lt; 40% coarse fragments as a weighted average in the uppermost 100 cm, in the other 20% of the area, the soil has 85% coarse fragments as a weighted average in the uppermost 75 cm. The soils are calcareous and silty. This map unit will be named as follows:\n\nat the first map scale level: dominant: Regosols associated: Leptosols\nat the second map scale level: dominant: Calcaric Regosols associated: Coarsic Leptosols\nat the third map scale level: dominant: Calcaric Regosols associated: Calcaric Coarsic Leptosols\n\nIn this example, the next applicable qualifier for the Regosols is Eutric. However, as high base saturation is already indicated by the Calcaric qualifier, the Eutric qualifier is redundant. Therefore, in this case, only one principal qualifier is applicable at the third map scale level. For associated soils, it is allowed to use fewer qualifiers than indicated for the scale level. If appropriate, at the third scale level, the Leptosols may just be named Coarsic Leptosols.\nThe high silt content may be expressed by the Siltic qualifier, which as a supplementary qualifier is elective in a map legend. It may be added at any scale level, for example:\n\nat the first map scale level: Regosols (Siltic)\nat the second map scale level: Calcaric Regosols (Siltic)\n\nPrincipal qualifiers, not required at the respective scale level, may also be added as elective qualifiers, for example:\n\nat the first map scale level: Regosols (Calcaric, Siltic)\nat the second map scale level: Calcaric Regosols (Siltic)\n\n\n\nExample 3\nA map unit, dominated by a soil with a thick layer of strongly decomposed acidic organic material, 70 cm thick and filled with rainwater, with continuous rock at 80 cm will be named as follows:\n\nat the first map scale level: Histosols\nat the second map scale level: Sapric Histosols\nat the third map scale level: Leptic Sapric Histosols\n\nIn this example, the next applicable qualifier is Ombric. As two qualifiers are already used, the third may be added as elective qualifier. In a similar way, elective qualifiers may be used at the other scale levels, for example:\n\nat the first map scale level: Histosols (Sapric)\nat the second map scale level: Sapric Histosols (Leptic, Ombric)\nat the third map scale level: Leptic Sapric Histosols (Ombric)\n\n\n\n\n\nPrietzel, Jörg, and Martin Wiesmeier. 2019. “A Concept to Optimize the Accuracy of Soil Surface Area and SOC Stock Quantification in Mountainous Landscapes.” Geoderma 356 (December): 113922. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.113922.",

    "text": "3.1.1 Albic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nAn albic horizon (from Latin albus, white) is a light-coloured horizon overlying an argic, natric, plinthic or spodic horizon or forming part of a layer with stagnic properties. It has low contents of Fe and Mn (depleted from both oxidized and reduced forms) and of organic matter, and at least one of these substances has previously been present and was lost due to clay migration, podzolization, and/or redox processes caused by water stagnation.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nAn albic horizon consists of mineral material and\n\nconsists of claric material;\nand\none or both of the following:\n\noverlies an argic, natric, plinthic or spodic horizon; or\nforms part of a layer with stagnic properties;\nand\n\nhas a thickness of ≥ 1 cm.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\nAlbic horizons are normally overlain by humus-enriched surface layers but may also be at the mineral soil surface as a result of erosion or artificial removal of the surface layer. Many albic horizons represent a strong expression of eluviation and are therefore called eluvial horizons. In sandy materials, albic horizons can reach considerable thickness, up to several metres, especially in humid tropical regions, and underlying diagnostic horizons may be hard to establish. Albic horizons generally have a weakly expressed soil aggregate structure, a single grain structure or a massive structure. Albic horizons are widely depleted from Fe, both the oxidized and the reduced forms, and typically do not show red colours when applying α,α-dipyridyl solution.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nWhile the albic horizon is the result of soil-forming processes, the claric material is only defined by colour criteria, and layers with claric material may or may not have undergone soil-forming processes. The definition of the albic horizon uses the argic, natric, plinthic or spodic horizon or the stagnic properties as criterion. The definitions of the spodic horizon and of the retic and stagnic properties, in turn, use the claric material as criterion.\nMany albic horizons that were formed by stagnant water do not show active reducing conditions.\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Anthraquic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nAn anthraquic horizon (from Greek anthropos, human being, and Latin aqua, water) is a surface horizon that results from wet-field cultivation and comprises a puddled layer and a plough pan.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nAn anthraquic horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material and has:\n\na puddled layer with the following Munsell colours, moist, in ≥ 80% of its exposed area:\n\na hue of 7.5YR or yellower, a value of ≤ 4 and a chroma of ≤ 2; or\na hue of GY, B or BG and a value of ≤ 4;\nand\n\na plough pan underlying the puddled layer, with all of the following:\n\none or both of the following:\n\na platy structure in ≥ 25% of its volume; or\na massive structure in ≥ 25% of its volume;\nand\n\na bulk density higher by ≥ 10% (relative) than that of the puddled layer;\nand\noximorphic features, in ≥ 5% of its exposed area (related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class), that:\n\nare predominantly on biopore walls and, if soil aggregates are present, predominantly on or adjacent to aggregate surfaces; and\nhave a Munsell colour hue ≥ 2.5 units redder and a chroma ≥ 1 unit higher, moist, than the surrounding material;\nand\n\n\na thickness of ≥ 15 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nAn anthraquic horizon shows evidence of reduction and oxidation owing to flooding for part of the year. When not flooded, it is very dispersible and has a loose packing of sorted small soil aggregates. The plough pan is compact, has a platy or massive structure and a very low infiltration rate. It has a reduced matrix and yellowish-brown, brown or reddish-brown oximorphic features along cracks and root channels due to oxygen release from plant roots.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nAfter a long time of wet-field cultivation, a hydragric horizon develops under the anthraquic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Argic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nAn argic horizon (from Latin argilla, white clay) is a subsurface horizon with a distinctly higher clay content than in the overlying horizon(s). The textural differentiation may be caused by:\n\nan illuvial accumulation of clay mineral\npredominant pedogenic formation of clay minerals in the subsoil\ndestruction of clay minerals in the overlying horizon\nselective surface erosion of clay minerals\nupward movement of coarser particles due to swelling and shrinking\nbiological activity, or\na combination of two or more of these different processes.\n\nIron (hydr)oxides are often accumulated or formed together with clay minerals, giving the argic horizon a redder hue and/or a higher chroma.\nA clay-richer stratum overlain by a clay-poorer stratum may resemble an argic horizon. However, a textural difference due only to a lithic discontinuity does not qualify as an argic horizon. In some soils, we may have both: a clay-poorer stratum overlying a clay-richer stratum and additionally a textural differentiation caused by soil-forming processes.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nAn argic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas a texture class of loamy sand or finer and ≥ 8% clay;\nand\none or both of the following:\n\nhas an overlying coarser-textured layer with all of the following:\n\nthe coarser-textured layer is not separated from the argic horizon by a lithic discontinuity; and\nif the coarser-textured layer directly overlies the argic horizon, its lowermost sublayer does not form part of a plough layer; and\nif the coarser-textured layer does not directly overlie the argic horizon, the transitional horizon between the coarser-textured layer and the argic horizon has a thickness of ≤ 15 cm; and\nif the coarser-textured layer has &lt; 15% clay, the argic horizon has ≥ 6% (absolute) more clay; and\nif the coarser-textured layer has ≥ 15 and &lt; 50% clay, the ratio of clay in the argic horizon to that of the coarser-textured layer is ≥ 1.4; and\nif the coarser-textured layer has ≥ 50% clay, the argic horizon has ≥ 20% (absolute) more clay;\nor\n\nhas evidence of illuvial clay in one or more of the following forms:\n\nclay bridges connecting ≥ 15% of the sand grains; or\nclay coatings covering ≥ 15% of the surfaces of soil aggregates, coarse fragments and/or biopore walls; or\nin thin sections, oriented clay bodies that constitute ≥ 1% of the section and and that have not been transported laterally after they had been formed; or\na ratio of fine clay to total clay in the argic horizon greater by ≥ 1.2 times than the ratio in the overlying coarser-textured layer;\nand\n\n\nboth of the following:\n\ndoes not form part of a natric horizon; and\ndoes not form part of a spodic horizon, unless illuvial clay is evidenced by one or more of the diagnostic criteria listed under 2.b;\nand\n\nhas a thickness of one-tenth or more of the thickness of the overlying mineral material, if present, and one of the following:\n\n≥ 7.5 cm (if composed of lamellae: combined thickness within 50 cm of the upper limit of the uppermost lamella) if the argic horizon has a texture class of sandy loam or finer; or\n≥ 15 cm (if composed of lamellae: combined thickness within 50 cm of the upper limit of the uppermost lamella).\n\n\n\n\nField identification\nTextural differentiation and the evidence of clay illuviation are the main features of argic horizons. The recognition of clay coatings and clay bridges is explained in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.23).\nIn shrink-swell soils, clay coatings at soil aggregate surfaces are easily confused with pressure faces (stress cutans). Pressure faces do not differ in colour from the original aggregate and do not occur on coarse fragments and biopore walls.\n\n\nAdditional information\nThe illuvial character of an argic horizon can best be established using thin sections. Diagnostic illuvial argic horizons show areas with oriented clay bodies that constitute on average ≥ 1% of the entire cross-section. Other tests involved are particle-size distribution analysis to determine the increase in clay content over a specified depth, and the fine clay/total clay ratio. In illuvial argic horizons, the fine clay to total clay ratio is larger than in the overlying horizons, due to preferential transport of fine clay particles.\nIf the soil shows a lithic discontinuity directly over the argic horizon, or if the surface horizon has been removed by erosion, or if a plough layer directly overlies the argic horizon, then the illuvial nature must be clearly established (diagnostic criterion 2.b).\nThe argic horizon may be subdivided into several lamellae with coarser-textured layers in between.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nArgic horizons are normally situated below eluvial horizons i.e. horizons from which clay minerals have been removed, commonly together with oxides and some organic matter. Although initially formed as a subsurface horizon, argic horizons may occur at the mineral soil surface as a result of erosion or removal of the overlying horizons. Afterwards, new sediments may be added.\nSome argic horizons fulfil all the diagnostic criteria of the ferralic horizon. Ferralsols must have a ferralic horizon and may have an argic horizon as well, which may or may not overlap with the ferralic horizon; but if an argic horizon is present, it must have in its upper 30 cm: &lt; 10% water-dispersible clay or a ΔpH (pHKCl - pHwater) ≥ 0 or ≥ 1.4% soil organic carbon.\nArgic horizons lack the sodium saturation characteristics of the natric horizon.\nArgic horizons in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in humid tropical and subtropical regions may occur in association with sombric horizons.\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Calcic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA calcic horizon (from Latin calx, lime) is a horizon in which secondary calcium carbonate (CaCO3) has accumulated as discontinuous concentrations. The accumulation usually occurs in subsurface layers, or more rarely, in surface horizons. The calcic horizon may contain primary carbonates as well.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA calcic horizon:\n\nhas a calcium carbonate equivalent of ≥ 15% (related to the fine earth plus concentrations of secondary carbonates of any size and any cementation class);\nand\none or both of the following:\n\nmeets the diagnostic criteria of protocalcic properties; or\nhas a calcium carbonate equivalent of ≥ 5% higher (absolute, related to the fine earth plus concentrations of secondary carbonates of any size and any cementation class) than that of the underlying layer and no lithic discontinuity between the two layers; and\n\ndoes not form part of a petrocalcic horizon;\nand\nhas a thickness of ≥ 15 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nCalcium carbonate can be identified in the field using 1 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution. The degree of effervescence is an indication of its amount (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.4.25).\nSecondary carbonates are visible as usually discrete permanent accumulations (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.4.25). In the calcic horizon, they are predominantly non-cemented or less than moderately cemented. However, discontinuous accumulations, which are moderately or more cemented, may also occur.\nOther possible indications of a calcic horizon are:\n\nwhite, pinkish to reddish, or grey colours (if not overlapping horizons rich in organic carbon)\na low porosity (interaggregate porosity is usually less than in the horizon directly above, and possibly also less than in the horizon directly below).\n\nWhen sampling, please make sure that the sample includes the accumulations of secondary carbonates in order to obtain the laboratory data for criteria 1 and 2.b.\n\n\nAdditional information\nThe determination of carbonates in the laboratory (Annex 2, Chapter 9.9) uses an acid and measures the evolved CO2. It may stem from various carbonates, but the carbonate content is calculated as if it were only from calcium carbonate. This is called the calcium carbonate equivalent.\nDetermination of the amount of calcium carbonate (by mass) and the changes of calcium carbonate content within the soil profile are the main analytical criteria for establishing the presence of a calcic horizon. Lithic discontinuities and any change of water permeability may favour the formation of secondary carbonates. Determination of pHwater enables distinction between accumulations with a basic (calcic) character (pH 8-8.7) due to the dominance of CaCO3, and those with an ultrabasic (non-calcic) character (pH &gt; 8.7) because of the presence of Na2CO3 and/or MgCO3.\nIn addition, the analysis of thin sections may reveal the presence of calcium carbonate pedofeatures (e.g. nodules, pendents) or evidence of silicate epigenesis (calcite pseudomorphs after primary minerals), besides evidences of removal of carbonates in layers above or below the calcic horizon.\nIf the accumulation of soft carbonates is such that all or most of the soil structure and/or rock structure disappears and continuous concentrations of calcium carbonate prevail, the Hypercalcic qualifier is used.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nWhen calcic horizons become continuously cemented with a cementation class of at least moderately cemented, transition takes place to the petrocalcic horizon, the expression of which may be massive or platy. A calcic horizon and a petrocalcic horizon may overlie each other.\nAccumulations of secondary carbonates, not qualifying for a calcic horizon, may fulfil the diagnostic criteria of protocalcic properties, which are fulfilled by most calcic horizons as well. Calcaric material includes primary carbonates.\nIn dry regions and in the presence of sulfate-bearing soil or groundwater solutions, calcic horizons occur associated with gypsic horizons. Calcic and gypsic horizons typically (but not always) occupy different positions in the soil profile because gypsum is more soluble than calcium carbonate, and they can normally be distinguished clearly from each other by a difference in crystal morphology. Gypsum crystals tend to be needle-shaped, usually visible to the naked eye, whereas pedogenic calcium carbonate crystals are much finer in size.\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Cambic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA cambic horizon (from Latin cambire, to change) is a subsurface horizon showing evidence of soil formation that ranges from weak to relatively strong. The cambic horizon shows soil aggregate structure at least in half of the volume of the fine earth. If the underlying layer has the same parent material, the cambic horizon usually shows higher oxide and/or clay contents than this underlying layer and/or evidence of removal of carbonates and/or gypsum. The soil formation in a cambic horizon can also be established by contrast with one of the overlying mineral horizons that are generally richer in organic matter and therefore have a darker and/or less intense colour.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA cambic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas a texture class of\n\nsandy loam or finer; or\nvery fine sand or loamy very fine sand;\nand\n\nhas soil aggregate structure in ≥ 50% (by volume);\nand\nshows evidence of soil formation in one or more of the following:\n\ncompared to the directly underlying layer, not separated from the cambic horizon by a lithic discontinuity, one or more of the following:\n\nif the underlying layer has a Munsell colour hue of 5YR or redder, a hue ≥ 2.5 units yellower, else a hue ≥ 2.5 units redder, all moist and in ≥ 90% of its exposed area; or\na Munsell colour chroma ≥ 1 unit higher, moist and in ≥ 90% of its exposed area; or\na clay content ≥ 4% (absolute) higher;\nor\n\ncompared to an overlying mineral layer, ≥ 5 cm thick and not separated from the cambic horizon by a lithic discontinuity, one or more of the following:\n\na Munsell colour hue ≥ 2.5 units redder, moist and in ≥ 90% of its exposed area; or\na Munsell colour value ≥ 1 unit higher, moist and in ≥ 90% of its exposed area; or\na Munsell colour chroma ≥ 1 unit higher, moist and in ≥ 90% of its exposed area;\nor\n\ncompared to the directly underlying layer, not showing gleyic properties and not forming part of a calcic or gypsic horizon, evidence of removal of carbonates or gypsum by one or more of the following:\n\n≥ 5% (absolute) less calcium carbonate equivalent or ≥ 5% (absolute) less gypsum and no lithic discontinuity between this underlying layer and the cambic horizon; or\nprotocalcic properties or protogypsic properties in the underlying layer but not in the cambic horizon;\nor\n\nall of the following:\n\nFedith ≥ 0.1%; and\na ratio between Feox and Fedith of ≥ 0.1; and\na Munsell colour hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y and a chroma of &gt; 3, all moist and in ≥ 90% of its exposed area;\nand\n\n\ndoes not form part of a plough layer, does not form part of an albic, anthraquic, argic, calcic, duric, ferralic, fragic, gypsic, hortic, hydragric, irragric, limonic, mollic, natric, nitic, petrocalcic, petroduric, petrogypsic, petroplinthic, pisoplinthic, plaggic, plinthic, pretic, salic, sombric, spodic, terric, tsitelic, umbric or vertic horizon and does not from part of a layer with andic properties;\nand\nhas a thickness of ≥ 15 cm.\n\n\n\nAdditional characteristics\nIn many cambic horizons, Fe oxides are formed, which give the horizon a redder hue and a higher chroma. However, if the parent material has much hematite, the formation of goethite in cooler and humid conditions usually makes it yellower.\nDissolution of carbonates or gypsum is a widespread feature of cambic horizons in both humid and semi-arid environments. In many cases, this may be proven by a lesser carbonate or gypsum content compared to the underlying layer. However, in some soils, especially in arid and semi-arid areas, this lesser content is not evident. In these soils, the presence of protocalcic or protogypsic properties in the underlying layer is a proof that carbonates or gypsum have been dissolved in the horizon above. On the other hand, such accumulations may also be caused by ascending groundwater in soils with gleyic properties, and gleyic properties have to be excluded in the underlying layer for this comparison.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nThe cambic horizon can be considered the predecessor of many other diagnostic horizons, all of which have specific properties that are not or only weakly expressed in the cambic horizon – such as illuvial or residual accumulations, removal of substances other than carbonates or gypsum, accumulation of soluble components, or the development of specific soil structure like wedge-shaped aggregates.\nCambic horizons in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in humid tropical and subtropical regions may occur in association with sombric horizons. The ratio between Feox and Fedith differentiates the cambic horizon from the tsitelic horizon (higher ratio). The plinthic and the petroplinthic horizon have usually much higher Fedith contents.\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Chernic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA chernic horizon (from Russian chorniy, black) is a relatively thick, well-structured, very dark-coloured surface horizon, with a high base saturation, a high animal activity and a moderate to high content of organic matter.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA chernic horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material and has:\n\n≥ 50% (by volume, weighted average, related to the whole soil) fine earth and does not consist of mulmic material; and\nsingle or in combination, in ≥ 90% (by volume):\n\ngranular structure; or\nsubangular blocky structure with an average aggregate size of ≤ 2 cm; or\ncloddy structure or other structural elements created by agricultural practices;\nand\n\n≥ 1% soil organic carbon;\nand\none of the following:\n\nin ≥ 90% of the exposed area of the entire horizon or of the subhorizons below any plough layer, a Munsell colour value of ≤ 3 moist, and ≤ 5 dry, and a chroma of ≤ 2 moist;\nor\nall of the following:\n\n≥ 15 and &lt; 40% calcium carbonate equivalent; and\nin ≥ 90% of the exposed area of the entire horizon or of the subhorizons below any plough layer, a Munsell colour value of ≤ 3 and a chroma of ≤ 2, both moist; and\n≥ 1.5% soil organic carbon;\nor\n\nall of the following:\n\n≥ 40% calcium carbonate equivalent and/or a texture class of loamy sand or coarser; and\nin ≥ 90% of the exposed area of the entire horizon or of the subhorizons below any plough layer, a Munsell colour value of ≤ 5 and a chroma of ≤ 2, both moist; and\n≥ 2.5% soil organic carbon;\nand\n\n\nif a layer is present that corresponds to the parent material of the chernic horizon and that has a Munsell colour value of ≤ 4, moist, ≥ 1% (absolute) more soil organic carbon than this layer;\nand\na base saturation (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of ≥ 50%;\nand\na thickness of ≥ 30 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nA chernic horizon may easily be identified by its blackish colour, caused by the accumulation of organic matter, its well-developed granular or subangular blocky structure, an indication of high base saturation (e.g. pHwater &gt; 6), and its thickness.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nThe chernic horizon is a special case of the mollic horizon with a higher content of soil organic carbon, a lower chroma, generally better developed soil structure, a minimum content of fine earth and a greater minimum thickness. The upper limit of the content of soil organic carbon is 20%, which is the lower limit for organic material.\n\n\n\n3.1.7 Cohesic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA cohesic horizon (from Latin cohaerere, to stick together) is a subsurface horizon with a massive structure or a weak subangular blocky structure. It is poor in organic matter and iron oxides, normally contains quartz, and the clay fraction is dominated by kaolinite. It is typical for old landscapes of the tropics with a seasonal climate.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA cohesic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas &lt; 0.5% soil organic carbon; and\nhas ≥ 15% clay; and\nhas a CEC (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of &lt; 24 cmolc kg-1 clay; and\nhas, single or in combination, a massive structure or a weak subangular blocky structure; and\nis not cemented; and\nhas, when dry, a rupture-resistance class of at least hard; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 10 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nCohesic horizons are very resistant to penetration of knife or hammer and have a rupture-resistance class of hard to extremely hard when dry, becoming friable or firm when moist.\n\n\nAdditional information\nCohesic horizons have a porosity low enough to restrict root penetration, but drainage is usually not restricted. The low porosity is attributed to parallel orientation of kaolinite crystals and infilling of voids by clay particles. Usually, they have a bulk density higher than the over- and underlying layers. They are typically found directly below a surface horizon.\nMany soils with the cohesic horizon have the Caráter coeso in the Brazilian system and have an apedal B horizon in the South African system. Cohesic horizons may also occur in paleosols.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nCohesic horizons may coincide with ferralic or, less widespread, with argic horizons. They differ strongly from nitic horizons. Some cohesic horizons show active or relict stagnic properties or overlie a plinthic, pisoplinthic or petroplinthic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.8 Cryic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA cryic horizon (from Greek kryos, cold, ice) is a perennially frozen soil horizon in mineral or organic material.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA cryic horizon has:\n\ncontinuously for ≥ 2 consecutive years one of the following:\n\nmassive ice, cementation by ice or readily visible ice crystals; or\na soil temperature of &lt; 0 °C and insufficient water to form readily visible ice crystals;\nand\n\na thickness of ≥ 5 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nCryic horizons occur in areas with permafrost and most of them show evidence of perennial ice segregation. Many of them are overlain by horizons with evidence of cryogenic alteration (mixed soil material, disrupted soil horizons, involutions, organic intrusions, frost heave, separation of coarse fragments from fine earth, cracks). Patterned surface features (earth hummocks, frost mounds, stone circles, stripes, nets and polygons) are common. To identify cryogenic alteration, a soil profile should intersect different elements of patterned ground, if present, or be wider than 2 m.\nSoils that contain saline water do not freeze at 0 °C. In order to develop a cryic horizon, such soils must be cold enough to freeze.\n\n\nAdditional information\nPermafrost is defined as follows: layer of soil or rock, at some depth beneath the surface, in which the temperature has been continuously below 0 °C for at least some years. It exists where summer heating fails to reach the base of the layer of frozen ground (Arctic Climatology and Meteorology Glossary, National Snow and Ice Data Center, Boulder, USA).\nEngineers distinguish between warm and cold permafrost. Warm permafrost has a temperature &gt; -2 °C and has to be considered unstable. Cold permafrost has a temperature of ≤ -2 °C and can be used more safely for construction purposes provided the temperature remains under control.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nCryic horizons may fulfil the diagnostic criteria of histic, folic or spodic horizons and may occur in association with salic, calcic, mollic or umbric horizons. In cold arid regions, yermic properties may be present.\n\n\n\n3.1.9 Duric horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA duric horizon (from Latin durus, hard) is a subsurface horizon showing nodules or concretions (durinodes), cemented by silica (SiO2), presumably in the form of opal and microcrystalline silica. Many durinodes have carbonate coatings. It may also contain remnants of a broken-up petroduric horizon.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA duric horizon consists of mineral material and has:\n\n≥ 10% (by volume, related to the whole soil) of nodules or concretions (durinodes) and/or of remnants of a broken-up petroduric horizon with all of the following:\n\nhave ≥ 1% (by exposed area of the nodules or concretions) accumulation of visible secondary silica; and\nwhen air-dry, &lt; 50% (by volume) slake in 1 M HCl, even after prolonged soaking, and\nwhen air-dry, ≥ 50% (by volume) slake in hot concentrated KOH or hot concentrated NaOH, at least if alternating with 1 M HCl; and\nare cemented, at least partially by secondary silica, with a cementation class of at least weakly cemented, both before and after treatment with acid; and\nhave a diameter of ≥ 1 cm; and\n\na thickness of ≥ 10 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe identification of secondary silica is described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.27). The durinodes are usually hard (high penetration resistance). Many durinodes are brittle when moist, both before and after treatment with acid.\n\n\nAdditional information\nDry durinodes do not slake appreciably in water, but prolonged soaking can result in the breaking-off of very thin platelets and some slaking. In cross-section, most durinodes are roughly concentric, and concentric stringers of opal may be visible under a hand lens.\nIf both silica and carbonates are present as cementing agents, the durinodes will only slake if hot concentrated KOH or NaOH (to dissolve the silica) are alternated with HCl (to dissolve the carbonates). If carbonates are absent, KOH or NaOH alone will be able to slake the durinodes.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nIn arid regions, duric horizons occur in association with gypsic, petrogypsic, calcic and petrocalcic horizons. A horizon continuously cemented by silica is a petroduric horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.10 Ferralic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA ferralic horizon (from Latin ferrum, iron, and alumen, alum) is a subsurface horizon resulting from long and intense weathering. The clay fraction is dominated by low-activity clays and contains various amounts of resistant minerals such as (hydr-)oxides of Fe, Al, Mn and Ti. There may be a marked residual accumulation of quartz in the silt or sand fractions.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA ferralic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas a texture class of sandy loam or finer and ≥ 8% clay; and\nhas &lt; 80% (by volume, related to the whole soil) coarse fragments, pisoplinthic concretions or nodules or remnants of a broken-up petroplinthic horizon, &gt; 2 mm; and\nhas a CEC (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of &lt; 16 cmolc kg-1 clay; and\nhas &lt; 10% (by grain count) easily weatherable minerals in the 0.05–0.2 mm fraction; and\ndoes not have andic or vitric properties; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 30 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nFerralic horizons are associated with old and stable landforms. The macrostructure is moderate to weak but typical ferralic horizons have a strong microaggregation.\nFerralic horizons rich in Fe oxides (especially rich in hematite) have usually a friable rupture-resistance class, moist. Disrupted dry soil material flows like flour between the fingers. Lumps of ferralic horizons are usually relatively light in mass because of the low bulk density. Many ferralic horizons give a hollow sound when tapped, indicating high porosity. In some ferralic horizons, the high porosity is the result of termite activity. Generally, the voids between the microaggregates provide a high porosity.\nIf the ferralic horizon has less hematite and a more yellowish colour, it typically shows a higher bulk density and a lower porosity. It is massive or has a weak subangular blocky structure and a firm rupture-resistance class, moist.\nIndicators of clay illuviation such as clay coatings are generally absent or rare, as are pressure faces and other stress features. Boundaries of a ferralic horizon are normally gradual to diffuse, and little variation in colour or particle-size distribution within the horizon can be detected.\n\n\nAdditional information\nAs an alternative to the weatherable minerals requirement, a total reserve of bases (TRB = exchangeable plus mineral calcium [Ca], magnesium [Mg], potassium [K] and sodium [Na]) of &lt; 25 cmolc kg-1 soil may be indicative.\nFerralic horizons normally have &lt; 10% water-dispersible clay. Occasionally they may have more water-dispersible clay, but if so, they have a ΔpH (pHKCl - pHwater) ≥ 0 or a relatively high content of organic carbon.\nExamples of easily weatherable minerals are all 2:1 phyllosilicates, chlorites, sepiolites, palygorskites, allophanes, 1:1 trioctahedral phyllosilicates (serpentines), feldspars, feldspathoids, ferromagnesian minerals, glass, zeolites, dolomite and apatite. The intent of the term weatherable minerals is to include those minerals that are unstable in humid climates compared with other minerals, such as quartz and 1:1 clay minerals, but that are more resistant to weathering than calcite Soil Survey Staff (1999).\nIn thin sections, ferralic horizons have generally an undifferentiated b-fabric due to the isotropic behaviour of Fe oxides. The groundmass has commonly a granular microstructure, with a porosity composed by packing pores and star-like vughs, besides channels and chambers due to a strong bioturbation.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nSome argic horizons fulfil all the diagnostic criteria of the ferralic horizon.\nAlox, Feox, Siox in ferralic horizons are very low, which sets them apart from the nitic horizons and layers with andic or vitric properties.\nSome cambic horizons have a low CEC; however, the amount of weatherable minerals or the TRB is too high for a ferralic horizon. Such horizons represent an advanced stage of weathering and a transition to the ferralic horizon.\nFerralic horizons in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in humid tropical and subtropical regions may occur in association with sombric horizons.\nDue to redox processes, ferralic horizons may develop into plinthic horizons. Most plinthic horizons also fulfil the diagnostic criteria of ferralic horizons.\n\n\n\n3.1.11 Ferric horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA ferric horizon (from Latin ferrum, iron) has formed by redox processes, usually caused by stagnant water, which may be active or relict, and shows redoximorphic features. The segregation of Fe (or Fe and Mn) has advanced to such an extent that oximorphic features (coarse masses or discrete concretions and/or nodules) have formed inside soil aggregates, and the matrix between them is largely depleted of Fe and Mn. They do not necessarily have enhanced Fe (or Fe and Mn) contents, but Fe (or Fe and Mn) are concentrated in the oximorphic features. Generally, such segregation leads to poor aggregation of the soil particles in Fe- and Mn-depleted zones and a compaction of the horizon. It mainly occurs in old landscapes.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA ferric horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nconsists of one or more subhorizons with one or both of the following:\n\n≥ 15% of its exposed area occupied by oximorphic features in the form of coarse (&gt; 20 mm, average length of the greatest dimension) masses inside soil aggregates that are black or have a Munsell colour hue redder than 7.5YR and a chroma of ≥ 5, both moist; or\n≥ 5% of its exposed area (related to the fine earth plus concretions and/or nodules of any size and cementation class) occupied by oximorphic features in the form of concretions and/or nodules with a cementation class of at least weakly cemented, a reddish and/or blackish colour and a diameter of &gt; 2 mm; and\n\ndoes not form part of a petroplinthic, pisoplinthic or plinthic horizon; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 15 cm.\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nIn tropical or subtropical regions, ferric horizons may grade laterally into plinthic horizons. In plinthic horizons, the amount of oximorphic features reaches ≥ 15% (by exposed area). Additionally, in plinthic horizons, a certain content of Fedith is exceeded and/or it changes irreversibly to a continuously cemented layer on exposure to repeated drying and wetting with free access of oxygen. If the amount of concretions and/or nodules with a cementation class of at least moderately cemented reaches ≥ 40% (by exposed area), it is a pisoplinthic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.12 Folic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA folic horizon (from Latin folium, leaf) consists of well-aerated organic material. It develops at the soil surface. In places, it may be covered by mineral material. Folic horizons predominantly occur in cool climate or at high elevation.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA folic horizon consists of organic material and:\n\nis saturated with water for &lt; 30 consecutive days in most years and is not drained; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 10 cm.\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nThe folic horizon has characteristics similar to the histic horizon. However, the histic horizon forms while saturated with water consecutively for at least 30 days in most years, which causes a completely different vegetation and therefore a different character of the organic material.\nThe organic material sets the folic horizon apart from chernic, mollic or umbric horizons, which consist of mineral material. Folic horizons may show andic or vitric properties.\n\n\n\n3.1.13 Fragic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA fragic horizon (from Latin fragilis, fragile) is a natural, predominantly non-cemented subsurface horizon with large soil aggregates and a porosity pattern such that roots and percolating water penetrate the soil only in between these aggregates. The natural character excludes plough pans and surface traffic pans.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA fragic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\n≥ 60% (by volume) consist, single or in combination, of prismatic, columnar, angular or subangular blocky soil aggregates that are without coarse roots and that have an average horizontal spacing (aggregate centre to aggregate centre) of ≥ 10 cm; and\nshows evidence of soil formation as defined in criterion 3 of the cambic horizon, at least on the faces of the soil aggregates; and\nthe soil material in between the soil aggregates and ≥ 50% of the volume of the aggregated soil are not cemented; and\nthe non-cemented parts do not cement upon repeated drying and wetting; and\nthe non-cemented aggregated parts have a brittle manner of failure and a rupture-resistance class, moist, of at least firm; and\nhas &lt; 0.5% soil organic carbon; and\ndoes not show effervescence after adding a 1 M HCl solution; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 15 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nA fragic horizon has a prismatic and/or blocky structure. In some fragic horizons, the soil aggregates have a high bulk density. In others, the inner parts of the aggregates may have a relatively high total porosity but, as a result of a dense outer rim, there is no continuity between the pores within and outside the aggregates. Between the prisms or the angular blocks, a weaker aggregate structure or a massive structure and mostly also a lighter soil colour is found. The result is a closed box system with ≥ 60% of the soil volume that cannot be explored by roots and is not percolated by water. Possible reasons for the dense outer rim are: clay coatings, swelling and shrinking, or the pressure of the roots growing only vertically.\nIt is essential that the required soil volume is inspected from both vertical and horizontal sections; horizontal sections often reveal a polygonal pattern. Three or four such polygons (or a cut up to 1 m2) are sufficient to test the volumetric basis for the definition of the fragic horizon.\nFragic horizons are commonly loamy, but loamy sand and clay textures are not excluded. In the latter case, the clay mineralogy is dominantly kaolinitic.\nThe aggregates have commonly a penetration resistance ≥ 4 MPa at field capacity.\nThe fragic horizon has little faunal activity, except occasionally between the aggregates.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nA fragic horizon may underlie (but not necessarily directly) an albic, cambic, spodic or argic horizon, unless the soil has been truncated. It can overlap partly or completely with an argic horizon, and if so, the fragic horizon may show retic properties or albeluvic glossae. Many fragic horizons have reducing conditions and stagnic properties.\nContrary to fragic horizons, plinthic horizons will cement upon repeated drying and wetting. Contrary to fragic horizons, many other root-restricting horizons are cemented.\n\n\n\n3.1.14 Gypsic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA gypsic horizon (from Greek gypsos, gypsum) is a non-cemented horizon containing accumulations of secondary gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) in various forms. It may be a surface or a subsurface horizon.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA gypsic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas ≥ 5% gypsum (related to the fine earth plus concentrations of secondary gypsum of any size and any cementation class); and\nhas one or both of the following:\n\nmeets the diagnostic criteria of protogypsic properties; or\na gypsum content of ≥ 5% higher (absolute, related to the fine earth plus concentrations of secondary gypsum of any size and any cementation class) than that of the underlying layer and no lithic discontinuity between the two layers; and\n\nhas a product of thickness (in centimetres) times gypsum content (percentage, by mass) of ≥ 150; and\ndoes not form part of a petrogypsic horizon; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 15 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nHow to recognize secondary gypsum is described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.26). The accumulation may be in distinct form or flour-like. The latter gives the gypsic horizon a massive structure.\nGypsum crystals may be visually mistaken for quartz. Gypsum is soft and can easily be scratched with a knife or broken between thumbnail and forefinger. Quartz is hard and cannot be broken except by hammering.\n\n\nAdditional information\nThe recommended procedure to determine gypsum in the laboratory (Annex 2, Chapter 9.10) also extracts anhydrite, which is considered to be mainly primary.\nThin section analysis is helpful to establish the presence of secondary gypsum, as individual gypsic pedofeatures or as generalized accumulations in the groundmass.\nIf the accumulation of gypsum becomes such that all or most of the soil structure and/or rock structure disappears and continuous concentrations of gypsum prevail, the Hypergypsic qualifier is used.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nWhen gypsic horizons become continuously cemented, transition takes place to the petrogypsic horizon, the expression of which may be as massive or platy structures. A gypsic horizon and a petrogypsic horizon may overlie each other. Accumulations of secondary gypsum, not qualifying for a gypsic horizon, may fulfil the diagnostic criteria of protogypsic properties, which are fulfilled by most gypsic horizons as well. Gypsiric material includes primary gypsum.\nIn dry regions, gypsic horizons may be associated with calcic and/or salic horizons. Calcic and gypsic horizons usually occupy distinct positions in the soil profile as the solubility of calcium carbonate is less than that of gypsum. They can normally be distinguished clearly from each other by the morphology (see calcic horizon). Salic and gypsic horizons also occupy different positions in the profile due to different solubilities.\n\n\n\n3.1.15 Histic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA histic horizon (from Greek histos, tissue) consists of poorly aerated organic material. It develops at the soil surface. In places, it may be covered by mineral material.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA histic horizon consists of organic material and:\n\nis saturated with water for ≥ 30 consecutive days in most years or is drained; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 10 cm,\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nHistic horizons have characteristics similar to the folic horizon. However, the folic horizon is consecutively saturated with water for less than thirty days in most years, which causes a completely different vegetation and therefore a different character of the organic material. Histic horizons may show andic or vitric properties.\n\n\n\n3.1.16 Hortic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA hortic horizon (from Latin hortus, garden) is a mineral surface horizon created by the human activities of deep cultivation, intensive fertilization and/or long-continued application of human and animal wastes and other organic residues (e.g. manures, kitchen refuse, compost and night soil).\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA hortic horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material and has:\n\na Munsell colour value and chroma of ≤ 3, moist; and\n≥ 1% soil organic carbon; and\n≥ 120 mg kg-1 P in the Mehlich-3 extract in the upper 20 cm; and\na base saturation (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of ≥ 50%; and\n≥ 25% (by exposed area, weighted average) of animal pores, coprolites or other traces of soil animal activity; and\na thickness of ≥ 20 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe hortic horizon is thoroughly mixed. Potsherds and other artefacts are common, although often abraded. Tillage marks or evidence of mixing of the soil can be present.\n\n\nAdditional information\n120 mg kg-1 P in the Mehlich-3 extract roughly correspond to 43.6 mg kg-1 P or 100 mg kg-1 P2O5 in the Olsen extract (Kabała et al. 2018), which was the requirement in former editions of WRB.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nSome hortic horizons may also fulfil the diagnostic criteria of a pretic, terric, mollic or chernic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.17 Hydragric horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA hydragric horizon (from Greek hydor, water, and Latin ager, field) is a subsurface horizon that results from wet-field cultivation.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA hydragric horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nis overlain by an anthraquic horizon; and\nconsists of one or more subhorizons and each of them has one or more of the following:\n\nreductimorphic features with a Munsell colour value of ≥ 4 and a chroma of ≤ 2, both moist, around biopore walls; or\n≥ 15% (by exposed area, related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class) oximorphic features that:\n\nare predominantly inside soil aggregates; and\nhave a Munsell colour hue ≥ 2.5 units redder and a chroma ≥ 1 unit higher, moist, than the surrounding material; or\n\n≥ 15% (by exposed area, related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class) oximorphic features that:\n\nare predominantly on biopore walls and, if soil aggregates are present, predominantly on or adjacent to aggregate surfaces; and\nhave a Munsell colour hue ≥ 2.5 units redder and a chroma ≥ 1 unit higher, moist, than the surrounding material; or\n\nFedith ≥ 1.5 times and/or Mndith ≥ 3 times that of the weighted average of the puddled layer of the overlying anthraquic horizon; and\n\nhas a thickness of ≥ 10 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe hydragric horizon occurs below the plough pan of an anthraquic horizon. The features listed as part of diagnostic criterion 2 rarely occur altogether in the same subhorizon but are commonly distributed over several subhorizons. Major subhorizons have reductimorphic features in pores with a Munsell colour hue of 2.5Y or yellower and a chroma of ≤ 2, both moist, and/or concentrations of Fe and/or Mn oxides inside soil aggregates as a result of oxidizing conditions. It usually shows grey coatings on soil aggregate surfaces, consisting of clay, fine silt and organic matter.\n\n\nAdditional information\nReduced manganese and/or iron move down slowly through the plough pan of the overlying anthraquic horizon into the hydragric horizon; the manganese tending to move further than the iron. Within the hydragric horizon, manganese and iron migrate further into the interiors of the soil aggregates where they are oxidized. In the lower part, subhorizons may be influenced by groundwater.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nThe hydragric horizon underlies an anthraquic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.18 Irragric horizon\n\nGeneral description\nAn irragric horizon (from Latin irrigare, to irrigate, and ager, field) is a mineral surface horizon that builds up gradually through continuous application of irrigation water with substantial amounts of sediments, often including artefacts and a significant amount of organic matter.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nAn irragric horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material and:\n\nhas, single or in combination, in ≥ 90% (by volume):\n\nsoil aggregate structure; or\ncloddy structure or other structural elements created by agricultural practices; and\n\nhas one or both of the following:\n\na clay content ≥ 10% (relative) and ≥ 3% (absolute) higher than that of the layer directly buried by the irragric horizon; or\na fine clay content ≥ 10% (relative) and ≥ 3% (absolute) higher than that of the layer directly buried by the irragric horizon; and\n\nhas differences in medium sand contents, fine sand contents, very fine sand contents, silt contents, clay contents and carbonate contents of &lt; 20% (relative) or &lt; 4% (absolute) between subhorizons; and\nhas both of the following:\n\n≥ 0.3% soil organic carbon; and\na weighted average of ≥ 0.5% soil organic carbon; and\n\nhas ≥ 25% (by exposed area, weighted average) of animal pores, coprolites or other traces of soil animal activity; and\nshows evidence that the land surface has been raised; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 20 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nSoils with an irragric horizon show evidence of surface raising, which may be inferred from either field observations or from historical records. The irragric horizon shows evidence of considerable animal activity. The lower boundary is clear; and irrigation deposits or buried soils may be present below.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nDue to continuous ploughing, irragric horizons lack the continuous stratification of fluvic material. Some irragric horizons may also qualify as mollic or umbric horizons, depending on their base saturation.\n\n\n\n3.1.19 Limonic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA limonic horizon (from Greek leimon, meadow) develops in layers with gleyic properties and oximorphic features. Reduced Fe and/or Mn move upwards with ascending groundwater, are oxidized and accumulate to such an extent that at least some parts of the accumulation zones are cemented. It is traditionally called bog iron.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA limonic horizon:\n\nhas ≥ 50% (by exposed area, related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class) oximorphic features that\n\nare black, surrounded by lighter-coloured material, or\nhave a Munsell colour hue ≥ 2.5 units redder and a chroma ≥ 1 unit higher, moist, than the surrounding material or\nhave a Munsell colour hue ≥ 2.5 units redder and a chroma ≥ 1 unit higher, moist, than the matrix of the directly underlying layer; and\n\nthe oximorphic features are one or both of the following:\n\npredominantly on (former) biopore walls and, if soil aggregates are or were present, predominantly on or adjacent to (former) aggregate surfaces; or\nunderlain by a layer with ≥ 95% (by exposed area) reductimorphic features that have the following Munsell colours, moist:\n\na hue of N, 10Y, GY, G, BG, B or PB; or\na hue of 2.5Y or 5Y and a chroma of ≤ 2; and\n\n\nis cemented with a cementation class of at least moderately cemented in ≥ 25% (by volume, related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class); and\nhas ≥ 2.5% Fedith + Mndith (related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class); and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 2.5 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nLimonic horizons show the typical characteristics of layers with gleyic properties and oximorphic features. In addition, they are at least partially cemented.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nLimonic horizons develop in layers with gleyic properties and oximorphic features. The process of groundwater ascent may be active or relict. Limonic horizons differ from tsitelic horizons, which are non-cemented and, if fine-textured, have a low bulk density. Limonic horizons, especially if with Mn oxides, may resemble spodic horizons, but typically lack the Al translocation required for spodic horizons. However, limonic horizons may overlap with spodic horizons, especially with the lower part of the spodic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.20 Mollic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA mollic horizon (from Latin mollis, soft) is a relatively thick, dark-coloured surface horizon with a high base saturation and a moderate to high content of organic matter.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA mollic horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material and has:\n\nsingle or in combination, in ≥ 50% (by volume):\n\nsoil aggregate structure with an average aggregate size of ≤ 10 cm; or\ncloddy structure or other structural elements created by agricultural practices; and\n\n≥ 0.6% soil organic carbon; and\none of the following:\n\nin ≥ 90% of the exposed area of the entire horizon or of the subhorizons below any plough layer, a Munsell colour value of ≤ 3 moist, and ≤ 5 dry, and a chroma of ≤ 3 moist; or\nall of the following:\n\na sum of calcium carbonate equivalent and gypsum of ≥ 15 and &lt; 40%; and\nin ≥ 90% of the exposed area of the entire horizon or of the subhorizons below any plough layer, a Munsell colour value of ≤ 3 and a chroma of ≤ 3, both moist; and\n≥ 1% soil organic carbon; or\n\nall of the following:\n\na sum of calcium carbonate equivalent and gypsum of ≥ 40% and/or a texture class of loamy sand or coarser; and\nin ≥ 90% of the exposed area of the entire horizon or of the subhorizons below any plough layer, a Munsell colour value of ≤ 5 and a chroma of ≤ 3, both moist; and\n≥ 2.5% soil organic carbon; and\n\n\nif a layer is present that corresponds to the parent material of the mollic horizon and that has a Munsell colour value of ≤ 4, moist, ≥ 0.6% (absolute) more soil organic carbon than this layer; and\na base saturation (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of ≥ 50% on a weighted average; and\na thickness of one of the following:\n\n≥ 10 cm if directly overlying continuous rock, technic hard material or a cryic, petrocalcic, petroduric, petrogypsicor petroplinthic horizon; or\n≥ 20 cm.\n\n\n\n\nField identification\nA mollic horizon may easily be identified by its dark colour, caused by the accumulation of organic matter, in most cases a well-developed structure (usually a granular or subangular blocky structure), an indication of high base saturation (e.g. pHwater &gt; 6), and its thickness.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nThe base saturation of ≥ 50% separates the mollic horizon from the umbric horizon, which is otherwise similar. The upper limit of the content of soil organic carbon is 20%, which is the lower limit for organic material.\nA special type of mollic horizon is the chernic horizon. It requires a higher content of soil organic carbon, a lower chroma, a better developed soil structure, a minimum content of fine earth and a greater minimum thickness.\nSome hortic, irragric, pretic or terric horizons may also qualify as mollic horizons.\n\n\n\n3.1.21 Natric horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA natric horizon (from Arabic natroon, salt) is a dense subsurface horizon with a distinctly higher clay content than in the overlying horizon(s). It has a high content of exchangeable Na and in some cases, a relatively high content of exchangeable Mg.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA natric horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas a texture class of loamy sand or finer and ≥ 8% clay; and\none or both of the following:\n\nhas an overlying coarser-textured layer with all of the following:\n\nthe coarser-textured layer is not separated from the natric horizon by a lithic discontinuity; and\nif the coarser-textured layer directly overlies the natric horizon, its lowermost sublayer does not form part of a plough layer; and\nif the coarser-textured layer does not directly overlie the natric horizon, the transitional horizon between the coarser-textured layer and the natric horizon has a thickness of ≤ 15 cm; and\nif the coarser-textured layer has &lt; 15% clay, the natric horizon has ≥ 6% (absolute) more clay; and\nif the coarser-textured layer has ≥ 15 and &lt; 50% clay, the ratio of clay in the natric horizon to that of the coarser-textured layer is ≥ 1.4; and\nif the coarser-textured layer has ≥ 50% clay, the natric horizon has ≥  20% (absolute) more clay; or\n\nhas evidence of illuvial clay in one or more of the following forms:\n\nclay bridges connecting ≥ 15% of the sand grains; or\nclay coatings covering ≥ 15% of the surfaces of soil aggregates, coarse fragments and/or biopore walls; or\nin thin sections, oriented clay bodies (pure or interlayered with silt layers) that constitute ≥ 1% of the section and that have not been transported laterally after they had been formed; or\na ratio of fine clay to total clay in the natric horizon greater by ≥ 1.2 times than the ratio in the overlying coarser-textured layer; and\n\n\nhas one or more of the following:\n\na columnar or prismatic structure in some parts of the horizon; or\nboth of the following:\n\nan angular or subangular blocky structure; and\npenetrations of an overlying coarser-textured layer, in which there are uncoated sand and/or coarse silt grains, extending ≥ 2.5 cm into the natric horizon; and\n\n\nhas one of the following:\n\nan exchangeable Na percentage (ESP) of ≥ 15 throughout the entire natric horizon or its upper 40 cm, whichever is thinner; or\nboth of the following,\n\nmore exchangeable Mg plus Na than Ca plus exchange acidity (buffered at pH 8.2) throughout the entire natric horizon or its upper 40 cm, whichever is thinner; and\nan exchangeable Na percentage (ESP) of ≥ 15 in some subhorizon starting ≤ 50 cm below the upper limit of the natric horizon; and\n\n\nhas a thickness of one-tenth or more of the thickness of the overlying mineral material, if present, and one of the following:\n\n≥ 7.5 cm (if composed of lamellae: combined thickness within 50 cm of the upper limit of the uppermost lamella) if the natric horizon has a texture class of sandy loam or finer; or\n≥ 15 cm (if composed of lamellae: combined thickness within 50 cm of the upper limit of the uppermost lamella).\n\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe colour of many natric horizons ranges from brown to black, especially in the upper part, but lighter colours or yellow to red colours may also be found. The structure is usually coarse columnar or coarse prismatic, in places blocky. Rounded tops of the aggregates are characteristic. In many cases, they are covered by a whitish powder coming from the overlying eluvial horizon.\nBoth colour and structural characteristics depend on the composition of the exchangeable cations and the soluble salt content in the underlying layers. Often, thick and dark-coloured clay coatings occur, especially in the upper part of the horizon. Many natric horizons have poor soil aggregate stability and very low permeability under wet conditions. When dry, the rupture-resistance class of the natric horizon is at least hard. Soil reaction is commonly strongly alkaline with pHwater ≥ 8.5.\n\n\nAdditional information\nAnother measure to characterize the natric horizon is the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), which is ≥ 13. The SAR is calculated from soil solution data (Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ given in mmolc/litre): SAR = Na+/[(Ca2+ + Mg2+)/2]0.5.\nIn micromorphological studies, natric horizons have a specific fabric. The low structural stability is shown by a pore system with many vesicles and vughs. Pedofeatures consist of layered silt and clay cappings, coatings and infillings; clay intercalations and fragments of clay coatings in the groundmass, due to partial structure collapse.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nThe surface horizon may be rich in organic matter, have a thickness from a few centimetres to &gt; 25 cm and may be a mollic or chernic horizon. An albic horizon may be present between the surface and the natric horizon.\nFrequently, a salt-affected layer occurs below the natric horizon. The salt influence may extend into the natric horizon, which then becomes saline as well. Salts present may be chlorides, sulfates or carbonates/bicarbonates.\nThe high ESP of the humus-illuvial part of the natric horizon separates it from the sombric horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.22 Nitic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA nitic horizon (from Latin nitidus, shiny) is a clay-rich subsurface horizon. It has moderately to strongly developed blocky structure breaking to polyhedral or flat-edged elements with many shiny pressure faces.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA nitic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas ≥ 30% clay; and\nhas, single or in combination:\n\nmoderate to strong angular or subangular blocky structure, breaking into polyhedral or flat-edged second-level structure with stress features (shiny surfaces) at ≥ 25% of the surfaces of the soil aggregates of the second-level structure; or\npolyhedral structure with stress features (shiny surfaces) at ≥ 25% of the surfaces of the soil aggregates; and\n\nhas all of the following:\n\n≥ 4% Fedith (‘free iron’); and\n≥ 0.2% Feox (‘active iron’); and\na ratio between Feox and Fedith of ≥ 0.05; and\n\ndoes not form part of a plinthic horizon; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 30 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nA nitic horizon has ≥ 30% clay but may feel loamy. Little difference in clay content compared to the overlying and the underlying horizon and a gradual or diffuse distinctness of the horizon boundaries are typical. Similarly, there is no abrupt colour difference to the horizons directly above and below. The colours are of low value with a hue often 2.5YR, moist, but sometimes redder or yellower. The structure is moderate to strong blocky, breaking into polyhedral or flat-edged elements showing shiny pressure faces. In addition, clay coatings may be found. Nitic horizons do not show reducing conditions but may show relict oximorphic features, e.g., concretions and nodules of Fe and Mn oxides.\n\n\nAdditional information\nIn many nitic horizons, the CEC (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) is &lt; 36 cmolc kg-1 clay, or even &lt; 24 cmolc kg-1 clay. The sum of exchangeable bases (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) plus exchangeable Al (by 1 M KCl, unbuffered) is about half of the CEC. The moderate to low CEC reflects the dominance of 1:1 clay minerals (either kaolinite and/or [meta-]halloysite). Many nitic horizons have a ratio of water-dispersible clay to total clay of &lt; 0.1. Through the microscope, the birefringent fabric may be striated. Clay coatings, if present, normally form fine coatings around aggregates or may be incorporated into the matrix.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nThe nitic horizon may be considered as a strongly expressed cambic horizon with specific properties such as a high amount of oxalate-extractable (active) iron. Nitic horizons may show clay coatings and may satisfy the requirements of an argic horizon, although the clay content in the nitic horizon is not much higher than in the overlying horizon. Its mineralogy (kaolinitic/[meta]halloysitic) sets it apart from most vertic horizons, which have a dominantly smectitic mineralogy and usually occur in climates with a more pronounced dry season. However, nitic horizons may grade laterally into vertic horizons in lower landscape positions. The well-expressed soil structure, the high amount of oxalate-extractable iron, and in some cases, the intermediate CEC in nitic horizons set them apart from ferralic horizons. Nitic horizons strongly differ from cohesic horizons, which may also be rich in clay. Nitic horizons in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in humid tropical and subtropical regions may occur in association with sombric horizons.\n\n\n\n3.1.23 Panpaic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA panpaic horizon (from Quechua p’anpay, to bury) is a buried mineral surface horizon with a significant amount of organic matter formed before having been buried. It is considered a diagnostic horizon, although the process of burying is a geological process and not a soil-forming process.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA panpaic horizon is a buried surface horizon consisting of mineral material and has:\n\n≥ 0.2% soil organic carbon; and\na content of soil organic carbon ≥ 25% (relative) and ≥ 0.2% (absolute) higher than in the overlying layer; and\na lithic discontinuity at its upper limit; and\na thickness of ≥ 5 cm.\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nSome panpaic horizons also meet the criteria of the chernic, mollic or umbric horizon. They differ from the sombric horizon that has no lithic discontinuity at its upper limit. A panpaic horizon may form part of layers of fluvic material.\n\n\n\n3.1.24 Petrocalcic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA petrocalcic horizon (from Greek petros, rock, and Latin calx, lime) is cemented by calcium carbonate and in some places, by magnesium carbonate as well. It is either massive or platy in nature and has a very high penetration resistance.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA petrocalcic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nis strongly or extremely calcareous as shown by effervescence with 1 M HCl solution; and\nis cemented, at least partially by secondary carbonates, with a cementation class of at least moderately cemented; and\nis continuous to the extent that vertical fractures, if present, have an average horizontal spacing of ≥ 10 cm and occupy &lt; 20% (by volume, related to the whole soil), and\ndoes not have coarse roots except, if present, along the vertical fractures; and\nhas a thickness of one of the following\n\n≥ 1 cm if it is laminar and rests directly on continuous rock; or\n≥ 10 cm.\n\n\n\n\nField identification\nPetrocalcic horizons occur as non-platy calcrete (either massive or nodular) or as platy calcrete, of which the following types are the most common:\nLamellar calcrete: superimposed, separate, petrified layers varying in thickness from a few millimetres to several centimetres. The colour is generally white or pink.\nPetrified lamellar calcrete: one or several extremely petrified layers, grey or pink in colour. They are generally more cemented than the lamellar calcrete and very massive (no fine lamellar structures, but coarse lamellar structures may be present).\nNon-capillary pores in petrocalcic horizons are filled, and the hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow to very slow.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nIn arid regions, petrocalcic horizons may occur in association with (petro-)duric horizons, into which they may grade laterally. The cementing agent differentiates petrocalcic and (petro-)duric horizons. In petrocalcic horizons, calcium and some magnesium carbonate constitute the main cementing agent while some accessory silica may be present. In (petro-)duric horizons, silica is the main cementing agent, with or without calcium carbonate. Petrocalcic horizons also occur in association with gypsic or petrogypsic horizons. Horizons with a significant accumulation of secondary carbonates without continuous cementation qualify as calcic horizons.\n\n\n\n3.1.25 Petroduric horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA petroduric horizon (from Greek petros, rock, and Latin durus, hard), also known as duripan (United States) or dorbank (South Africa), is a subsurface horizon, usually reddish or reddish brown in colour, that is cemented mainly by illuvial secondary silica (SiO2, presumably opal and microcrystalline forms of silica). Calcium carbonate may be present as a supplementary cementing agent.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA petroduric horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas ≥ 1% (by exposed area, related to the fine earth plus accumulations of secondary silica of any size and any cementation class) accumulation of visible secondary silica; and\nboth of the following:\n\nwhen air-dry, &lt; 50% (by volume) slake in 1 M HCl, even after prolonged soaking, and\nwhen air-dry, ≥ 50% (by volume) slake in hot concentrated KOH or hot concentrated NaOH, at least if alternating with 1 M HCl; and\n\nis cemented, at least partially by secondary silica, with a cementation class of at least weakly cemented, both before and after treatment with acid; and\nis continuous to the extent that vertical fractures, if present, have an average horizontal spacing of ≥ 10 cm and occupy &lt; 20% (by volume, related to the whole soil); and\ndoes not have coarse roots except, if present, along the vertical fractures; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 1 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe identification of secondary silica is described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.27). Effervescence after applying 1 M HCl may take place but is mostly not as vigorous as in petrocalcic horizons, which appear similar. In very dry environments, the petroduric horizons commonly are platy. In less dry environments, vertical fractures are more common. It has usually a high penetration resistance.\n\n\nAdditional information\nIf both silica and carbonates are present as cementing agents, the petroduric horizon will only slake if hot concentrated KOH or NaOH (to dissolve the silica) are alternated with HCl (to dissolve the carbonates). If carbonates are absent, KOH or NaOH alone will be able to slake the petroduric horizon.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nIn arid climates, petroduric horizons may occur in association with petrocalcic horizons, into which they may grade laterally, and/or occur in conjunction with calcic or gypsic horizons. Remnants of a petroduric horizon or durinodes constitute a duric horizon. Petroduric horizons may develop from volcanic ashes and may be overlain by layers with andic or vitric properties.\n\n\n\n3.1.26 Petrogypsic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA petrogypsic horizon (from Greek petros, rock, and gypsos, gypsum) is a cemented horizon containing accumulations of secondary gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O).\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA petrogypsic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\n1. has ≥ 40% gypsum (related to the fine earth plus accumulations of secondary gypsum of any size and any cementation class); and\nhas ≥ 1% (by exposed area) visible secondary gypsum; and\nis cemented, at least partially by secondary gypsum, with a cementation class of at least extremely weakly cemented; and\nis continuous to the extent that vertical fractures, if present, have an average horizontal spacing of ≥ 10 cm and occupy &lt; 20% (by volume, related to the whole soil);\ndoes not have coarse roots except, if present, along the vertical fractures; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 1 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nPetrogypsic horizons are cemented, whitish and composed predominantly of gypsum. Old petrogypsic horizons may be capped by a thin, laminar layer of newly precipitated gypsum. How to recognize secondary gypsum is described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.26).\n\n\nAdditional information\nThe recommended procedure to determine gypsum in the laboratory (Annex 2, Chapter 9.10) also extracts anhydrite, which is considered to be mainly primary.\nIn thin sections, the petrogypsic horizon shows a a groundmass composed of interlocked gypsum crystals with a hypidiotopic or xenotopic fabric, mixed with varying amounts of detrital material.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nAs the petrogypsic horizon develops from a gypsic horizon, the two are closely related. Petrogypsic horizons frequently occur in association with (petro-)calcic horizons. Accumulations of calcium carbonate and gypsum usually occupy different positions in the soil profile because the solubility of calcium carbonate is less than that of gypsum. Normally, they can be distinguished clearly from each other by their morphology (see calcic horizon).\n\n\n\n3.1.27 Petroplinthic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA petroplinthic horizon (from Greek petros, rock, and plinthos, brick) is a continuous or fractured layer of cemented material, in which Fe (and in some cases also Mn) (hydr-)oxides are an important cement and in which organic matter is either absent or present only in traces. It has formed by continuous cementation of a plinthic or pisoplinthic horizon. Advanced crystallization of the oxides causes a very high penetration resistance. Traditional names for horizons similar to the petroplinthic horizon are ‘laterite’ or ‘ironstone’.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA petroplinthic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nconsists of oximorphic features in the form of reddish, yellowish and/or blackish concretions and/or nodules inside (former) soil aggregates that are at least partially interconnected; and\nhas one or both of the following:\n\n≥ 2.5% Fedith (related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class); or\n≥ 10% Fedith in the oximorphic features; and\n\nhas a ratio between Feox and Fedith of &lt; 0.1 in the fine earth or in the oximorphic features; and\nis cemented with a cementation class of at least strongly cemented; and\nis continuous to the extent that vertical fractures, if present, have an average horizontal spacing of ≥ 10 cm and occupy &lt; 20% (by volume, related to the whole soil); and\ndoes not have coarse roots except, if present, along the vertical fractures; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 10 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nPetroplinthic horizons are extremely hard (high penetration resistance) and typically rusty brown to yellowish brown. They are either massive or show an interconnected nodular pattern that encloses material with a lower penetration resistance. They may be fractured. Roots are generally found only in vertical fractures. Penetration resistance is ≥ 4.5 MPa in ≥ 50% of the volume of the fine earth. From this value upwards, the rupture resistance will not sink upon wetting (see Asiamah 2000).\n\n\nAdditional information\nThe ratio between Feox and Fedith has been estimated from data given by Varghese and Byju (1993).\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nPetroplinthic horizons are closely associated with plinthic and pisoplinthic horizons from which they develop. In some places, plinthic horizons can be traced by following petroplinthic layers that have formed, for example, in road cuts.\nThe low ratio between Feox and Fedith separates the petroplinthic horizon from cemented spodic horizons (Ortsteinic or Placic qualifiers), which in addition contain mostly a fair amount of organic matter. Limonic horizons also have higher ratios.\n\n\n\n3.1.28 Pisoplinthic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA pisoplinthic horizon (from Latin pisum, pea, and Greek plinthos, brick) contains a large amount of concretions and/or nodules that are at least moderately cemented by Fe (and in some cases also by Mn) (hydr-)oxides. It may also contain remnants of a broken-up petroplinthic horizon.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA pisoplinthic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas ≥ 40% of its volume (related to the whole soil) occupied by, single or in combination,\n\noximorphic features in the form of yellowish, reddish and/or blackish concretions and/or nodules; or\nremnants of a broken-up petroplinthic horizon, with a diameter of &gt; 2 mm and a cementation class of at least moderately cemented; and\n\ndoes not form part of a petroplinthic horizon; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 15 cm.\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nA pisoplinthic horizon results, when discrete concretions and/or nodules of a plinthic horizon reach a certain percentage and a cementation class of at least moderately cemented. The cementation class and the amount of concretions and/or nodules separate it from the ferric horizon. If the concretions and/or nodules are sufficiently interconnected, the pisoplinthic horizon becomes a petroplinthic horizon. A pisoplinthic horizon may also be formed by the fracturing of a petroplinthic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.29 Plaggic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA plaggic horizon (from Low German plaggen, sod) is a black or brown mineral surface horizon that results from human activity. Mostly in nutrient-poor soils in the north-western part of Central Europe from Medieval times until the introduction of mineral fertilizers at the beginning of the 20th century, sod and other topsoil materials were commonly used for bedding livestock. The sods consist of grassy, herbaceous or dwarf-shrub vegetation, its root mats and organic and mineral soil sticking to them. The mixture of sods and excrements was later spread on fields. The material brought in eventually produced an appreciably thickened horizon (in places &gt; 100 cm thick) that is rich in soil organic carbon. Base saturation is typically low.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA plaggic horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material and:\n\nhas a texture class of sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or loam, or a combination of them; and\none or more of the following:\n\ncontains artefacts, but &lt; 20% (by volume, related to the whole soil); or\nhas ≥ 100 mg kg-1 P in the Mehlich-3 extract in the upper 20 cm; or\nhas in its lower part spade or hook marks, remnants of a plough layer or other evidence of former agricultural activity; and\n\nhas a Munsell colour value of ≤ 4 moist, and ≤ 5 dry, and a chroma of ≤ 4 moist; and\nhas ≥ 0.6% soil organic carbon; and\nhas a base saturation (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of &lt; 50%, unless the soil has been limed or received mineral fertilizers; and\nshows evidence that the land surface has been raised; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 20 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe plaggic horizon has brownish or blackish colours, related to the origin of source materials. It may contain artefacts, but less than 20%. Its reaction is mostly slightly to strongly acid. The pH may have risen due to recent liming but seldom reaching a high base saturation. It may show evidence of old agricultural operations in its lower part, such as spade or hook marks as well as old plough layers. Plaggic horizons commonly overlie buried soils although the original surface layers may be mixed with the plaggen. In some cases, ditches have been made in the buried soil as a cultivation mode for soil improvement. The lower boundary is typically clear to abrupt.\n\n\nAdditional information\nThe texture class is in most cases sand or loamy sand. Sandy loam and loam are rare. The soil organic carbon may include carbon added with the plaggen. 100 mg kg-1 P in the Mehlich-3 extract (same value as for pretic horizons) roughly correspond to 143 mg kg-1 P or 327 mg kg-1 P2O5 in 1% citric acid (Kabała et al. 2018). Originally, the plaggic horizon has a low base saturation. If limed or fertilized, this criterion is waived.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nAfter liming, some plaggic horizons may fulfil the criteria of the terric horizon, but terric horizons usually have a higher animal activity. Some plaggic horizons may contain black carbon and also fulfil the criteria of the pretic horizon. Some plaggic horizons may also qualify as umbric or even as mollic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.30 Plinthic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA plinthic horizon (from Greek plinthos, brick) is a subsurface horizon that is rich in Fe (in some cases also Mn) (hydr-)oxides and poor in humus. The clay fraction is dominated by kaolinite, together with other products of strong weathering, such as gibbsite. It may contain quartz. The plinthic horizon has formed by redox processes, usually caused by stagnant water, which may be active or relict, and shows redoximorphic features. The plinthic horizon is not continuously cemented. On exposure to repeated drying and wetting with free access to oxygen, the oxides become more crystallized leading to a continuously cemented horizon.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA plinthic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas in ≥ 15% of its exposed area (related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class) oximorphic features inside (former) soil aggregates that are black or have a redder hue and a higher chroma than the surrounding material; and\none or more of the following:\n\nhas ≥ 2.5% Fedith (related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class); or\nhas ≥ 10% Fedith in the oximorphic features; or\nchanges irreversibly to a continuously cemented horizon with a cementation class of at least strongly cemented after repeated drying and wetting; and\n\nhas a ratio between Feox and Fedith of &lt; 0.1 in the fine earth or in the oximorphic features; and\ndoes not form part of a petroplinthic or pisoplinthic horizon; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 15 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nA plinthic horizon shows prominent redoximorphic features. In a perennially moist soil, many of the oximorphic features are non-cemented or have a low cementation class and can be cut with a spade.\n\n\nAdditional information\nMicromorphological studies may reveal the extent of impregnation of the soil mass by Fe (hydr-)oxides. In many plinthic horizons, prolonged reducing conditions are not present anymore.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nIf the concretions and nodules of the plinthic horizon become at least moderately cemented and reach ≥ 40% of the exposed area, the plinthic horizon becomes a pisoplinthic horizon. If the plinthic horizon becomes continuously cemented, the plinthic horizon becomes a petroplinthic horizon.\nIf the oximorphic features do not reach 15% of the exposed area, it may be a ferric horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.31 Pretic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA pretic horizon (from Portuguese preto, black) is a mineral surface horizon that results from human activities with the addition of black carbon, especially charcoal. It is characterized by its dark colour, usually the presence of artefacts (ceramic fragments, lithic instruments, bone or shell tools etc.) and high contents of organic carbon, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and micronutrients (mainly zinc and manganese), usually contrasting with natural soils in the surrounding area. It contains remnants of black carbon, which may be recognized visually or by chemical analyses.\nPretic horizons are for example widespread in the Amazon Basin, where they are the result of pre-Columbian activities and have persisted over many centuries despite the prevailing humid tropical conditions generally causing high organic matter mineralization rates. These soils with a pretic horizon are known as ‘Terra Preta de Indio’ or ‘Amazonian Dark Earths’. They generally have high organic carbon stocks. Many of them are dominated by low-activity clays.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA pretic horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material and has:\n\na Munsell colour value of ≤ 4 and a chroma of ≤ 3, both moist; and\n≥ 0.6% soil organic carbon; and\nexchangeable Ca plus Mg (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of ≥ 1 cmolc kg-1 fine earth; and\n≥ 100 mg kg-1 P in the Mehlich-3 extract; and\none or both of the following:\n\n≥ 1% (by exposed area, related to the fine earth plus black carbon of any size) visible black carbon; or\nboth of the following\n\n≥ 0.3% carbon belonging to molecules of black carbon, determined by chemical analyses; and\na ratio between carbon belonging to molecules of black carbon and total organic carbon of ≥ 0.15, determined by chemical analyses; and\n\n\none or more layers with a combined thickness of ≥ 20 cm.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\nBlack carbon is an artefact only if it is intentionally manufactured by humans. The minimum soil organic carbon content (criterion 2) must be fulfilled without the artefacts.\nP in the Mehlich-3 extract roughly is the double of the values obtained in the Mehlich-1 extract (Kabała et al. 2018), which was the requirement in the 3rd edition of WRB. Additionally, compared to the 3rd edition, the value was increased from 30 to 50 (Mehlich-1) or from 60 to 100 (Mehlich-3) mg kg-1.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nSome pretic horizons may also fulfil the criteria of the plaggic horizon and, especially in their upper parts, the criteria of the hortic horizon. Some pretic horizons may qualify as mollic or umbric horizons. Old charcoal hearths usually fail the P criterion of the pretic horizon. They do not fit into the concept of the pretic horizon, are characterized by the Carbonic and the Pyric qualifier, and many of them are Technosols.\n\n\n\n3.1.32 Protovertic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA protovertic horizon (from Greek proton, first, and Latin vertere, to turn) has swelling and shrinking clay minerals.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA protovertic horizon consists of mineral material and has:\n\n≥ 30% clay; and\none or more of the following:\n\nwedge-shaped soil aggregates in ≥ 10% (by volume); or\nslickensides on ≥ 5% of the surfaces of soil aggregates; or\nshrink-swell cracks; or\na coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE) of ≥ 0.06; and\n\na thickness of ≥ 15 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nWedge-shaped soil aggregates and slickensides (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.4.10 and 8.4.14) may not be immediately evident if the soil is moist. A decision about their presence can sometimes only be made after the soil has dried out. Wedge-shaped aggregates may be a second-level structure of larger angular blocky or prismatic elements, which should be carefully examined to see if wedge-shaped aggregates are present.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nIf the swelling and shrinking is more prominent (or the layer is thicker) the protovertic horizon grades into a vertic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.33 Salic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA salic horizon (from Latin sal, salt) is a surface horizon or a subsurface horizon at a shallow depth that contains high amounts of readily soluble salts, i.e. salts more soluble than gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O; log Ks = -4.85 at 25 °C).\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA salic horizon has:\n\nat some time of the year\n\nif the pHwater of the saturation extract is ≥ 8.5, an electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (ECe) of ≥ 8 dS m-1 measured at 25 °C and a product of thickness (in centimetres) and ECe (in dS m-1) of ≥ 240; or\nan electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (ECe) of ≥ 15 dS m-1 measured at 25 °C and a product of thickness (in centimetres) and ECe (in dS m-1) of ≥ 450; and\n\na thickness of ≥ 15 cm (combined thickness if there are superimposed subhorizons meeting criteria 1.a and 1.b).\n\n\n\nField identification\nHalophytes (e.g. some species of Salicornia, Tamarix and Suaeda) and salt-tolerant crops are first indicators. Salt-affected layers are often puffy. Salts precipitate only after evaporation of most soil moisture; if the soil is moist, salt may not be visible.\nSalts may precipitate at the soil surface (external Solonchaks) or at depth (internal Solonchaks). A salt crust, if present, may be part of the salic horizon.\n\n\nAdditional information\nIn alkaline carbonate soils, an ECe at 25 °C of ≥ 8 dS m-1 and a pHwater of ≥ 8.5 are very common. Salic horizons may consist of organic or mineral material.\n\n\n\n3.1.34 Sombric horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA sombric horizon (from French sombre, dark) is a dark-coloured subsurface horizon containing more organic matter than the directly overlying horizon. It has no lithic discontinuity at its upper limit and is neither associated with Al nor dispersed by Na.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA sombric horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas ≥ 0.2% soil organic carbon; and\nhas a content of soil organic carbon ≥ 25% (relative) and ≥ 0.2% (absolute) higher than in the overlying layer; and\ndoes not have a lithic discontinuity at its upper limit and does not form part of a natric or spodic horizon; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 10 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nSombric horizons are found in dark-coloured subsoils, in many cases associated with well-drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in humid tropical and subtropical regions. They resemble buried horizons but, in contrast to many of these, sombric horizons more or less follow the shape of the soil surface. They have a lower Munsell colour value than the directly overlying horizon and commonly a low base saturation.\n\n\nAdditional information\nThere are two important theories about the genesis of sombric horizons (Almeida, Lunardi Neto, and Vidal-Torrado 2015).\nFirst theory: The higher content of organic matter is illuvial, but neither associated with Al nor with Na. In this case, coatings of organic matter at soil aggregate surfaces and pore walls as well as illuvial organic matter in thin sections are found.\nSecond theory: The higher content of organic matter is residual. A moister climate and a higher plant biomass (e.g. forest) formed thick A horizons. Afterwards, climate became drier, the upper part of the old A horizon underwent an intense mineralization, while the residues of the current vegetation, poorer in biomass (e.g. savannah), form only a thin A horizon. At greater depth, mineralization is slower, and the lower part of the old A horizon is preserved, especially if climate is cool and base saturation low.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nSombric horizons may coincide with argic, cambic, ferralic or nitic horizons. Contrary to panpaic horizons, sombric horizons have no lithic discontinuity at their upper limit. Spodic horizons are differentiated from sombric horizons by their much higher CEC of the clay fraction. The humus-illuvial part of natric horizons has a higher clay content, a high Na saturation and a specific structure, which separates them from sombric horizons.\n\n\n\n3.1.35 Spodic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA spodic horizon (from Greek spodos, wood ash) is a subsurface horizon that contains illuvial substances. In most spodic horizons, the appearance of the upper subhorizons is characterized by dark illuvial organic matter and that of the lower subhorizons by intensely coloured illuvial Fe oxides. Some spodic horizons, however, show either little illuviation of Fe or little illuviation of organic matter. In all spodic horizons, illuviated Al can be proven analytically. The illuvial materials are characterized by a high pH-dependent charge, a relatively large specific surface and an elevated water retention. An overlying eluvial horizon may intrude with tongues into the spodic horizon.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA spodic horizon consists of mineral material and:\n\nhas a pH (1:1 in water) of &lt; 5.9, unless the soil has been limed or fertilized; and\nhas a subhorizon with an Alox value that is ≥ 1.5 times that of the lowest Alox value of all the mineral layers above the spodic horizon; and\nhas in its uppermost 1 cm one or both of the following:\n\n≥ 0.5% soil organic carbon; or\na Munsell colour chroma of ≥ 6, moist, in ≥ 85% of its exposed area; and\n\nhas in every subhorizon one of the following Munsell colours, moist, in ≥ 85% of their exposed area:\n\na hue of 5YR or redder; or\na hue of 7.5YR and a value of ≤ 5; or\na hue of 10YR and a value and a chroma of ≤ 2; or\na hue of 10YR and a chroma of ≥ 6; or\na colour of 10YR 3/1; or\na hue of N and a value of ≤ 2; and\n\none or more of the following:\n\nis overlain by claric material that is not separated from the spodic horizon by a lithic discontinuity and that overlies the spodic horizon either directly or above a transitional horizon that has a thickness of one-tenth or less of the overlying claric material; or\n≥ 10% of the sand grains of the horizon show cracked coatings; or\nhas a subhorizon that is cemented with a cementation class of at least weakly cemented in ≥ 50% of its horizontal extension; or\nhas a subhorizon with an Alox + ½Feox value of ≥ 0.5% that is ≥ 2 times that of the lowest Alox + ½Feox value of all the mineral layers above the spodic horizon; and\n\ndoes not form part of a natric horizon; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 2.5 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nMany spodic horizons underly claric material and have brownish-black to reddish-brown colours, which often fade downwards. The shape of many spodic horizons is wavy, irregular, or broken. Spodic horizons may be (partially) cemented. Thin and relatively continuous cementations are indicated by the Placic qualifier and thicker and/or less continuous cementations by the Ortsteinic qualifier. Spodic horizons may extend further down in ribbon-like accumulations, which are not included in the calculation of the minimum thickness.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nThere may be a hortic, plaggic, terric or umbric horizon above the spodic horizon, with or without claric material in between.\nSpodic horizons in volcanic materials may exhibit andic properties as well. Spodic horizons in other materials may exhibit some characteristics of the andic properties, but normally have a higher bulk density. For classification purposes, the presence of a spodic horizon, unless buried deeper than 50 cm, is given preference over the occurrence of andic properties.\nSome layers with andic properties resemble spodic horizons, if they are covered by relatively young, light-coloured volcanic ejecta that satisfy the requirements of claric material. There is a lithic discontinuity in between, which excludes them from being spodic horizons. This can be further proven by the following analyses: The uppermost 2.5 cm of the spodic horizon have a Cpy/OC and a Cf/Cpy of ≥ 0.5. Cpy, Cf and OC are pyrophosphate-extractable C, fulvic acid C and organic C, respectively (Ito et al. 1991).\nLimonic and tsitelic horizons may resemble spodic horizons, but lack the translocation of Al. However, limonic horizons may overlap with spodic horizons, especially with the lower part of the spodic horizon.\nSimilar to many spodic horizons, sombric horizons also contain more organic matter than an overlying layer. They can be differentiated from each other by the clay mineralogy. Kaolinite usually dominates in sombric horizons, whereas the clay fraction of spodic horizons commonly contains significant amounts of vermiculite and Al-interlayered chlorite.\nPlinthic horizons, which contain large amounts of accumulated Fe, have less Feox than spodic horizons.\n\n\n\n3.1.36 Terric horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA terric horizon (from Latin terra, earth) is a mineral surface horizon that develops through addition of mineral material or a combination of mineral material and organic residues, for example, fertile mineral soil, compost, calcareous beach sands, loess or mud. It may contain stones, randomly sorted and distributed. In most cases, it is built up gradually over a long period of time. Occasionally, terric horizons are created by single additions of material. Normally the added material is mixed with the original topsoil.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA terric horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material and:\n\nshows evidence of addition of material substantially different from the environment, where it has been placed; and\ncontains, if any, &lt; 10% (by volume, related to the whole soil) artefacts; and\nhas ≥ 0.6% soil organic carbon; and\nhas a base saturation (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of ≥ 50%; and\nshows evidence that the land surface has been raised; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 20 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nTerric horizons show characteristics related to the source material, e.g. in colour. Buried soils may be observed at the base of the horizon although mixing can obscure the contact. Soils with a terric horizon show a raised surface that may be inferred either from field observation or from historical records. The terric horizon is not homogeneous, but subhorizons are thoroughly mixed. It commonly contains a small amount of artefacts such as pottery fragments, cultural debris and refuse, that are typically very small (&lt; 1 cm in diameter) and very abraded.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nSome terric horizons may also fulfil the criteria of anthropogenic horizons with stronger alterations, like the hortic, plaggic or the pretic horizon. Most hortic horizons show more and most plaggic horizons less soil animal activity than the terric horizon. The pretic horizons contain black carbon. Some terric horizons may qualify as mollic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.1.37 Thionic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA thionic horizon (from Greek theion, sulfur) is an extremely acid subsurface horizon in which sulfuric acid is formed through oxidation of sulfides.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA thionic horizon has:\n\na pH (1:1 by mass in water, or in a minimum of water to permit measurement) of &lt; 4; and\none or more of the following:\n\naccumulations of iron or aluminium sulfate or hydroxysulfate minerals, predominantly on or adjacent to surfaces of soil aggregates; or\ndirect superposition on hypersulfidic material; or\n≥ 0.05% water-soluble sulfate; and\n\na thickness of ≥ 15 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nThionic horizons generally exhibit pale yellow jarosite or yellowish-brown schwertmannite accumulations on or adjacent to surfaces of soil aggregates. Soil reaction is extremely acid; pHwater of 3.5 is quite common. While mostly associated with recent sulfidic coastal sediments, thionic horizons may also develop inland in sulfidic materials that may be present either in natural deposits or in artefacts such as mine spoil.\n\n\nAdditional information\nIron or aluminium sulfate or hydroxysulfate minerals include jarosite, natrojarosite, schwertmannite, sideronatrite and tamarugite. Thionic horizons may consist of organic or mineral material.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nA thionic horizon often underlies a horizon with strongly expressed stagnic properties.\n\n\n\n3.1.38 Tsitelic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA tsitelic horizon (from Georgian tsiteli, red) shows a lateral accumulation of Fe. It is usually found on lower slopes or in depressions. Stagnosols and Planosols occur upslope in inclined positions and have lost reduced Fe by lateral subsurface water flow. Further down, the reduced Fe gets in contact with atmospheric oxygen, is oxidized and accumulates in subsurface horizons starting usually at shallow depths. They are rich in oxalate-extractable Fe, which gives the tsitelic horizons a homogeneous reddish colour.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA tsitelic horizon consists of mineral material and\n\nhas ≥ 1% Feox; and\nhas a ratio between Feox and Fedith of ≥ 0.5; and\nhas Alox &lt; Feox; and\nhas a Munsell colour chroma of ≥ 4, moist; and\ndoes not show reductimorphic features; and\ndoes not form part of a limonic or spodic horizon; and\nhas a thickness of ≥ 5 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe accumulation of ferrihydrites causes a homogeneous reddish colour and, if the horizon is fine-textured, a low bulk density and some thixotropy.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nTsitelic horizons may resemble spodic horizons of Rustic Podzols but lack the translocation of Al that is required for spodic horizons. If showing low bulk density and thixotropy, they may give the impression of andic properties, but they have neither a significant amount of allophanes and imogolites nor of Al-humus complexes. Contrary to most horizons with andic properties, tsitelic horizons show more Fe than Al in the oxalate extract. Layers with oximorphic features caused by gleyic properties may also look similar to tsitelic horizons. While in layers with gleyic properties, the oxides are predominantly found at soil aggregate surfaces, the oxides in tsitelic horizons fill the entire soil matrix homogeneously. Tsitelic horizons distinguish well from limonic horizons, which are (at least partially) cemented.\n\n\n\n3.1.39 Umbric horizon\n\nGeneral description\nAn umbric horizon (from Latin umbra, shade) is a relatively thick, dark-coloured surface horizon with a low base saturation and a moderate to high content of organic matter.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nAn umbric horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material and has:\n\nsingle or in combination, in ≥ 50% (by volume):\n\nsoil aggregate structure with an average aggregate size of ≤ 10 cm; or\ncloddy structure or other structural elements created by agricultural practices; and\n\n≥ 0.6% soil organic carbon; and\none or both of the following:\n\nin ≥ 90% of the exposed area of the entire horizon or of the subhorizons below any plough layer, a Munsell colour value of ≤ 3 moist, and ≤ 5 dry, and a chroma of ≤ 3 moist; or\nall of the following:\n\na texture class of loamy sand or coarser; and\nin ≥ 90% of the exposed area of the entire horizon or of the subhorizons below any plough layer, a Munsell colour value of ≤ 5 and a chroma of ≤ 3, both moist; and\n≥ 2.5% soil organic carbon;\n\n\nif a layer is present that corresponds to the parent material of the umbric horizon and that has a Munsell colour value of ≤ 4, moist, ≥ 0.6% (absolute) more soil organic carbon than this layer; and\na base saturation (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of &lt; 50% on a weighted average; and\na thickness of one of the following:\n\n≥ 10 cm if directly overlying continuous rock, technic hard material or a cryic, petroduric or petroplinthic horizon; or\n≥ 20 cm.\n\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe main field characteristics of an umbric horizon are its dark colour and its structure. In general, umbric horizons tend to have a lesser grade of soil structure than mollic horizons.\nMost umbric horizons have an acid reaction (pHwater &lt; 5.5), which usually indicates a base saturation of &lt; 50%. An additional indication for strong acidity is a shallow, horizontal rooting pattern in the absence of a physical barrier.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nThe base saturation requirement sets the umbric horizon apart from the mollic horizon, which is otherwise similar. The upper limit of the content of soil organic carbon is 20%, which is the lower limit for organic material.\nSome irragric and plaggic horizons may also qualify as umbric horizons.\n\n\n\n3.1.40 Vertic horizon\n\nGeneral description\nA vertic horizon (from Latin vertere, to turn) is a clay-rich subsurface horizon that, as a result of shrinking and swelling, has slickensides and wedge-shaped soil aggregates.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nA vertic horizon consists of mineral material and has:\n\n≥ 30% clay; and\none or both of the following:\n\na. in ≥ 20% (by volume), wedge-shaped soil aggregates with a longitudinal axis tilted between ≥ 10° and ≤ 60° from the horizontal; or\nslickensides on ≥ 10% of the surfaces of soil aggregates; and\n\nshrink-swell cracks; and\na thickness of ≥ 25 cm.\n\n\n\nField identification\nVertic horizons are clay-rich and, when dry, often have a rupture-resistance class of at least hard. Polished, shiny surfaces with striations (slickensides), often at sharp angles, are distinctive.\nWedge-shaped soil aggregates and slickensides (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.4.10 and 8.4.14) may not be immediately evident if the soil is moist. A decision about their presence can sometimes only be made after the soil has dried out. Wedge-shaped aggregates may be a second-level structure of larger angular blocky or prismatic elements, which should be carefully examined to see if wedge-shaped aggregates are present.\n\n\nAdditional information\nThe coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE, see Annex 2, Chapter 9.6) is usually ≥ 0.06.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nSeveral other diagnostic horizons may also have high clay contents, e.g., the argic, natric and nitic horizon. Most of them lack the characteristics typical for the vertic horizon. However, they may be laterally linked in the landscape with vertic horizons, the latter usually taking up the lowest position. Less pronounced swelling and shrinking of clay minerals leads to a protovertic horizon.",

    "text": "3.2 Diagnostic properties\nDiagnostic properties are characterized by a combination of attributes that reflect results of soil-forming processes or indicate specific conditions of soil formation. Their features can be observed or measured in the field or the laboratory and require a minimum or maximum expression to qualify as diagnostic. A minimum thickness is not part of the criteria.\n\n3.2.1 Abrupt textural difference\n\nGeneral description\nAn abrupt textural difference (from Latin abruptus, broken away) is a very sharp increase in clay content within a limited depth range.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nAn abrupt textural difference refers to two superimposed layers consisting of mineral material with all of the following:\n\nthe underlying layer has all of the following:\n\n≥  15% clay; and\na thickness of ≥ 7.5 cm; and\n\nthe underlying layer starts ≥ 10 cm from the mineral soil surface; and\nthe underlying layer has, compared to the overlying layer:\n\nat least twice as much clay if the overlying layer has &lt; 20% clay; or\n≥ 20% (absolute) more clay if the overlying layer has ≥ 20% clay; and\n\nif the limit between the two layers is not even, the depth of the abrupt textural difference is, where the underlying layer reaches ≥ 50% of the total volume; and\na transitional layer, if present, has a thickness of ≤ 2 cm.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\nAn example for an uneven limit between the two layers are retic properties in the underlying layer. Depending on the development of the retic properties, the abrupt textural difference may be at the upper limit of the retic properties or further down (criterion 3).\n\n\n\n3.2.2 Albeluvic glossae\n\nGeneral description\nThe term albeluvic glossae (from Latin albus, white, and eluere, to wash out, and Greek glossa, tongue) refers to penetrations of clay- and Fe-depleted material into an argic horizon. Albeluvic glossae occur along soil aggregate surfaces and form vertically continuous tongues. In horizontal sections, they exhibit a polygonal pattern.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nAlbeluvic glossae:\n\nrefer to an argic horizon and, if the argic horizon is &lt; 30 cm thick, also to the underlying layers until 30 cm below the upper limit of the argic horizon; and\nshow retic properties in the argic horizon; and\nhave continuous tongues consisting of coarser-textured material, as defined in the retic properties, that start at the upper limit of the argic horizon, with all of the following:\n\nhave a vertical extension of ≥ 30 cm; and\nhave a horizontal extension of ≥ 1 cm; and\noccupy ≥ 10 and &lt; 90% of the exposed area.\n\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nAlbeluvic glossae are a special case of retic properties. In retic properties, the coarser-textured parts may be thinner and are not necessarily vertically continuous. Retic properties may also be present in natric horizons whereas albeluvic glossae are defined only in argic horizons. The argic horizon into which the albeluvic glossae penetrate may also fulfil the diagnostic criteria of a fragic horizon. In undisturbed soils, the argic horizon with the albeluvic glossae is typically overlain by an albic or cambic horizon. However, the overlying horizons may be lost due to erosion or ploughing.\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Andic properties\n\nGeneral description\nAndic properties (from Japanese an, dark, and do, soil) result from moderate weathering of mainly pyroclastic deposits. The presence of short-range-order minerals and/or organo-metallic complexes is characteristic for andic properties. These minerals and complexes are commonly part of the weathering sequence in pyroclastic deposits (tephric material → vitric properties → andic properties). However, andic properties with organo-metallic complexes may also form in non-pyroclastic silicate-rich materials in cool-temperate and humid climates.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nAndic properties require:\n\na bulk density of ≤ 0.9 kg dm-3; and\nan Alox + ½Feox value of ≥ 2%; and\na phosphate retention of ≥ 85%.\n\n\n\nField identification\nAndic properties may be identified using the sodium fluoride field test of Fieldes and Perrott (1966). A pH in NaF of ≥ 9.5 indicates allophane and/or organo-aluminium complexes in carbonate-free soils. The test is indicative for most layers with andic properties, except for those very rich in organic matter. However, the same reaction occurs in spodic horizons and in certain acid clays that are rich in Al-interlayered clay minerals.\nAndic layers may exhibit thixotropy, i.e. the soil material changes, under pressure or by rubbing, from a plastic solid into a liquefied stage and back into the solid condition.\n\n\nAdditional information\nAndic properties may be found at the soil surface or in the subsurface, commonly occurring as layers. Many surface layers with andic properties contain a high amount of organic matter (≥ 5%), are commonly very dark coloured (Munsell colour value and chroma of ≤ 3, moist), have a fluffy macrostructure, and in some places show thixotropy. They have a low bulk density and commonly have a silt loam or finer texture. Andic surface layers rich in organic matter may be very thick, having a thickness of ≥ 50 cm in some soils. Andic subsurface layers are generally somewhat lighter coloured.\nIn perhumid climates, humus-rich andic layers may contain more than twice the water content of samples that have been dried at 105 °C and rewetted (hydric characteristic).\nFor bulk density, the volume is determined after an undried soil sample has been desorbed at 33 kPa (no prior drying), and afterwards the weight is determined at 105 °C.\nTwo major types of andic properties are recognized: one in which allophane, imogolite and similar minerals are predominant (Silandic qualifier); and one in which Al complexed by organic acids prevails (Aluandic qualifier). The silandic property typically gives a strongly acid to neutral soil reaction and is a bit lighter coloured, while the aluandic property gives an extremely acid to acid reaction and a blackish colour.\nUncultivated, organic matter-rich surface layers with silandic properties typically have a pHwater of ≥ 4.5, while uncultivated surface layers with aluandic properties and rich in organic matter typically have a pHwater of &lt; 4.5. Generally, pHwater in silandic subsoil layers is ≥ 5.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nVitric properties are distinguished from andic properties by a lesser degree of weathering. This is evidenced by the presence of volcanic glasses and usually by a lower amount of short-range-order pedogenic minerals and/or organo-metallic complexes, as characterized by a lower amount of Alox and Feox, a higher bulk density, or a lower phosphate retention. The diagnostic criteria of the vitric and andic properties are adapted after Shoji et al. (1996), Takahashi et al. (2004) and findings of the COST 622 Action (2004).\nSpodic horizons, which also contain complexes of oxides and organic substances, can exhibit andic properties as well. Andic properties may also be present in chernic, mollic or umbric horizons.\n\n\n\n3.2.4 Anthric properties\n\nGeneral description\nAnthric properties (from Greek anthropos, human being) refer to human-made mollic or umbric horizons. Some of the mollic horizons with anthric properties are natural umbric horizons transformed into mollic horizons by liming and fertilization. Thin, light-coloured or humus-poor mineral topsoil horizons may be transformed into umbric or even mollic horizons by long-term cultivation (ploughing, liming, fertilization etc.). Another group of artificial mollic or umbric horizons is created by ploughing organic surface layers into the mineral soil. In all these cases, the soil has very little animal activity, which is especially uncommon for soils with a mollic horizon.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nAnthric properties:\n\noccur in soils with a mollic or umbric horizon; and\nshow evidence of human disturbance by one or more of the following:\n\nan abrupt lower boundary at ploughing depth and ≥ 10% of the sand grains not coated by organic matter; or\nan abrupt lower boundary at ploughing depth and evidence of mixing of humus-richer and humus-poorer soil materials by ploughing; or\nlumps of applied lime; or\n≥ 430 mg kg-1 P in the Mehlich-3 extract in the upper 20 cm; and\n\nshow &lt; 5% (by exposed area) of animal pores, coprolites or other traces of soil animal activity in one or both of the following depths:\n\nin the lowermost 5 cm of the mollic or umbric horizon; or\nin a depth range of 5 cm below the plough layer, if present.\n\n\n\n\nField identification\nSigns of mixing or cultivation, evidence of liming (e.g. remnants of applied lime chunks), the dark colour and the almost complete absence of traces of soil animal activity are the main criteria for recognition. Incorporated humus-richer material may be established with the naked eye, using a 10x hand lens or using thin sections, depending on the degree of fragmentation/dispersion of the humus-richer material. The incorporated humus-richer material is typically weakly bound to the humus-poorer material, which is manifested by uncoated sand grains in a darker matrix throughout the mixed layer.\n\n\nAdditional information\n430 mg kg-1 P in the Mehlich-3 extract roughly correspond to 654 mg kg-1 P or 1500 mg kg-1 P2O5 in 1% citric acid (Kabała et al. 2018), which was the requirement in former editions of WRB. The original idea of the anthric properties is derived from Krogh & Greve (1999).\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nAnthric properties are an additional characteristic of some mollic or umbric horizons. Chernic horizons normally show a higher animal activity and do not have anthric properties.\n\n\n\n3.2.5 Continuous rock\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nContinuous rock (from Latin continuare, to continue) is consolidated material, exclusive of cemented pedogenic horizons such as limonic, petrocalcic, petroduric, petrogypsic, petroplinthic and spodic horizons. Continuous rock is sufficiently consolidated to remain intact when an air-dried specimen, 25–30 mm on one side, is submerged in water for 1 hour. The material is considered continuous only if cracks occupy &lt; 10% (by volume, related to the whole soil) of the continuous rock, with no significant displacement of the rock having taken place.\n\n\n\n3.2.6 Gleyic properties\n\nGeneral description\nGleyic properties (from Russian folk name gley, wet bluish clay) develop in layers that are saturated with groundwater (or were saturated in the past, if now drained) for a period long enough to allow reducing conditions to occur (this may range from a few days in the tropics to a few weeks in other areas) and in the capillary fringe above them. There may be gleyic properties without the presence of groundwater in a clay-rich layer over a layer rich in sand or coarse fragments. In some soils with gleyic properties, the reducing conditions are caused by upward moving gases such as methane or carbon dioxide. If there are no more reducing conditions, the gleyic properties are relict.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nGleyic properties refer to mineral material, show redoximorphic features and comprise one of the following:\n\na layer with ≥ 95% (by exposed area) reductimorphic features that have the following Munsell colours, moist:\n\na hue of N, 10Y, GY, G, BG, B or PB; or\na hue of 2.5Y or 5Y and a chroma of ≤ 2; or\n\na layer with &gt; 5% (by exposed area, related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class) oximorphic features that:\n\nare predominantly on biopore walls and, if soil aggregates are present, predominantly on or adjacent to aggregate surfaces; and\nhave a Munsell colour hue ≥ 2.5 units redder and a chroma ≥ 1 unit higher, moist, than the surrounding material or than the matrix of the directly underlying layer; or\n\na combination of two layers: a layer fulfilling diagnostic criterion 2 and a directly underlying layer fulfilling diagnostic criterion 1.\n\n\n\nField identification\nRedoximorphic features are described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.20).\n\n\nAdditional information\nGleyic properties result from a redox gradient between groundwater and the capillary fringe causing an uneven distribution of iron or manganese (hydr-)oxides. In the lower part of the soil and/or inside the soil aggregates, the oxides are either transformed into soluble Fe/Mn(II) compounds or they are translocated; both processes lead to the absence of colours that have a Munsell hue redder than 2.5Y. Translocated Fe and Mn compounds can be concentrated in the oxidized form (Fe[III], Mn[IV]) on soil aggregate surfaces or on biopore walls (rusty root channels), and towards the surface even in the matrix. Mn concentrations can be recognized by strong effervescence using a 10% H2O2 solution.\nReductimorphic features reflect permanently wet conditions. In loamy and clayey material, blue-green colours predominate owing to Fe(II, III) hydroxy salts (green rust). If the material is rich in sulfur (S), blackish colours prevail owing to colloidal iron sulfides such as greigite or mackinawite (easily recognized by smell, after applying 1 M HCl). In calcareous material, whitish colours are dominant owing to calcite and/or siderite. Sands are usually light grey to white in colour and also often impoverished in Fe and Mn. Bluish-green and black colours are unstable and often oxidize to a reddish brown colour within a few hours of exposure to air. The upper part of a reductimorphic layer may show up to 5% rusty colours, mainly around channels of burrowing animals or plant roots.\nOximorphic features reflect oxidizing conditions, as in the capillary fringe and in the surface horizons of soils with fluctuating groundwater levels. Specific colours indicate ferrihydrite (reddish brown), goethite (bright yellowish brown), lepidocrocite (orange), schwertmannite (dark orange) and jarosite (pale yellow). In loamy and clayey soils, the iron oxides/hydroxides are concentrated on soil aggregate surfaces and the walls of larger pores (e.g. old root channels).\nIn most cases, a layer fulfilling diagnostic criterion 2 overlies a layer fulfilling criterion 1. Some soils, including underwater soils (freshwater or seawater) and tidal soils have only a layer that fulfils diagnostic criterion 1 and no layer fulfilling criterion 2.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nGleyic properties differ from stagnic properties. Gleyic properties are caused by an upward moving agent (mostly groundwater) that causes reducing conditions and that leads to an underlying strongly reduced layer and an overlying layer with oximorphic features on or adjacent to soil aggregate surfaces. (In some soils only one of these layers is present.) Stagnic properties are caused by stagnation of an intruding agent (mostly rainwater) that causes reducing conditions and that leads to an overlying Fe-poor layer and an underlying layer with oximorphic features inside the soil aggregates. (In some soils, only one of these layers is present.)\n\n\n\n3.2.7 Lithic discontinuity\n\nGeneral description\nLithic discontinuities (from Greek lithos, stone, and Latin continuare, to continue) represent significant differences in parent material within a soil. A lithic discontinuity can also denote different times of deposition. The different strata may have the same or a different mineralogy.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nWhen comparing two directly superimposed layers consisting of mineral material, a lithic discontinuity requires one or more of the following:\n\nan abrupt difference in particle-size distribution that is not solely associated with a change in clay content resulting from soil formation; or\nboth of the following:\n\none or more of the following:\n\n≥ 10% coarse sand and ≥ 10% medium sand, and a difference of ≥ 25% in the ratio coarse sand to medium sand, and a difference of ≥ 5% (absolute) in the content of coarse sand and/or medium sand; or\n≥ 10% coarse sand and ≥ 10% fine sand, and a difference of ≥ 25% in the ratio coarse sand to fine sand, and a difference of ≥ 5% (absolute) in the content of coarse sand and/or fine sand; or\n≥ 10% medium sand and ≥ 10% fine sand, and a difference of ≥ 25% in the ratio medium sand to fine sand, and a difference of ≥ 5% (absolute) in the content of medium sand and/or fine sand; or\n≥ 10% sand and ≥ 10% silt, and a difference of ≥ 25% in the ratio sand to silt, and a difference of ≥ 5% (absolute) in the content of sand and/or silt; and\n\nthe differences do not result from original variation within the parent material in the form of patches of different particle-size fractions within a layer; or\n\nthe layers have coarse fragments with different lithology; or\na layer containing coarse fragments without weathering rinds overlying a layer containing coarse fragments with weathering rinds; or\na layer with angular coarse fragments overlying or underlying a layer with rounded coarse fragments; or\nan overlying layer that has ≥ 10% (absolute, by volume, related to the whole soil) more coarse fragments than the underlying layer, unless the difference is created by animal activity; or\na lower amount of coarse fragments in the overlying layer that cannot be explained by advanced weathering in the overlying layer; or\nabrupt differences in colour not resulting from soil formation; or\nmarked differences in size and shape of resistant minerals (as shown by micromorphological or mineralogical methods); or\ndifferences in the TiO2/ZrO2 ratios of the sand fraction by a factor of ≥ 2; or\ndifferences in CEC (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) per kg clay by a factor of ≥ 2.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\nIn some cases, a lithic discontinuity may be suggested by one of the following: a horizontal line of coarse fragments (stone line) overlying and underlying layers with lesser amounts of coarse fragments, or a decreasing percentage of coarse fragments with increasing depth. On the other hand, the sorting action of small fauna such as termites can produce similar effects in what would initially have been lithically uniform parent material.\nDiagnostic criterion 2 is illustrated by the following example:\nLayer 1: 20% coarse sand, 10% medium sand → ratio coarse sand to medium sand: 2.\nLayer 2: 15% coarse sand, 10% medium sand → ratio coarse sand to medium sand: 1.5. Difference in ratios: 25%\nDifference in contents of coarse sand (absolute): 5%\nDifference in contents of medium sand (absolute): 0\nResult: between the two layers, there is a lithic discontinuity.\nGenerally, the mathematical formula for calculating differences in ratios is:\nABS(ratioi-ratioi+1)/MAX(ratioi; ratioi+1)*100\n\n\n\n3.2.8 Protocalcic properties\n\nGeneral description\nProtocalcic properties (from Greek proton, first, and Latin calx, lime) refer to carbonates that are derived from the soil solution and precipitated in the soil. They do not belong to the soil parent material or to other sources such as dust. They occur across the soil structure or fabric. These carbonates are called secondary carbonates. For protocalcic properties, they must be permanent and be present in significant quantities.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nProtocalcic properties refer to concentrations of secondary carbonates, visible when moist, that show one or more of the following:\n\noccupy ≥ 5% of the exposed area (related to the fine earth plus concentrations of secondary carbonates of any size and any cementation class) with masses, nodules, concretions or filaments; or\ncover ≥ 10% of the surfaces of soil aggregates or biopore walls; or\ncover ≥ 10% of the underside surfaces of coarse fragments or of remnants of a cemented horizon.\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe identification of secondary carbonates is described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.25).\n\n\nAdditional information\nAccumulations of secondary carbonates qualify as protocalcic properties only if they are permanent and do not come and go with changing moisture conditions. This should be checked by spraying some water on them.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nAccumulations of secondary carbonates with higher contents of calcium carbonate equivalent may qualify for a calcic horizon, or if continuously cemented with a cementation class of at least moderately cemented, for a petrocalcic horizon. Calcaric material refers to the presence of carbonates in the entire fine earth, which usually includes primary carbonates.\n\n\n\n3.2.9 Protogypsic properties\n\nGeneral description\nProtogypsic properties (from Greek proton, first, and gypsos, gypsum) refer to gypsum that is derived from the soil solution and precipitated in the soil. It does not belong to the soil parent material or to other sources such as dust. This gypsum is called secondary gypsum.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nProtogypsic properties refer to visible concentrations of secondary gypsum that occupy ≥ 1% of the exposed area (related to the fine earth plus accumulations of secondary gypsum of any size and any cementation class).\n\n\nField identification\nThe identification of secondary gypsum is described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.26).\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nAccumulations of secondary gypsum with higher gypsum contents may qualify for a gypsic horizon, or if continuously cemented, for a petrogypsic horizon. Gypsiric material includes primary gypsum.\n\n\n\n3.2.10 Reducing conditions\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nReducing conditions (from Latin reducere, to draw back) show one or more of the following:\n\na negative logarithm of the hydrogen partial pressure (rH, calculated as Eh·29-1 + 2·pH) of &lt; 20; or\nthe presence of free Fe2+, as shown on a freshly broken and smoothed surface of a field-wet soil by the appearance of a strong red colour after wetting it with 0.2% α,α-dipyridyl dissolved in 1 N ammonium acetate (NH4OAc), pH 7; or\nthe presence of iron sulfide; or\nthe presence of methane.\n\nCaution: α,α-dipyridyl solution is toxic if swallowed and harmful if absorbed through skin or inhaled. It has to be used with care. In layers with a neutral or alkaline soil reaction it may not give the strong red colour.\n\n\n\n3.2.11 Retic properties\n\nGeneral description\nRetic properties (from Latin rete, net) describe the interfingering of coarser-textured claric material into a finer-textured argic or natric horizon. The interfingering coarser-textured claric material is characterized by a partial removal of clay minerals and iron oxides. There may be also coarser-textured claric material falling from the overlying horizon into cracks in the argic or natric horizon. The coarser-textured claric material is found as vertical, horizontal and inclined interfingerings between soil aggregates.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nRetic properties refer to a combination of finer-textured parts and coarser-textured parts, both consisting of mineral material, within the same layer, with all of the following:\n\nthe finer-textured parts belong to an argic or natric horizon; and\nthe coarser-textured parts consist of claric material; and\nthe finer-textured parts have, compared with the coarser-textured parts, the following Munsell colour, moist:\n\na hue ≥ 2.5 units redder: or\na value ≥ 1 unit lower; or\na chroma ≥ 1 unit higher; and\n\nthe clay content of the finer-textured parts is higher compared with the coarser-textured parts, as specified for the argic or natric horizon, criterion 2.a; and\nthe coarser-textured parts are ≥ 0.5 cm wide; and\nthe coarser-textured parts start at the upper limit of the argic or natric horizon; and\nthe coarser-textured parts occupy areas ≥ 10 and &lt; 90% in both vertical and horizontal sections, within\n\nthe upper 30 cm of the argic or natric horizon; or\nthe entire argic or natric horizon,\nwhichever is thinner; and\n\ndo not occur within a plough layer.\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nRetic properties include the special case of albeluvic glossae. The argic or natric horizons that exhibit retic properties may also satisfy the requirements of a fragic horizon. A layer with retic properties may also show stagnic properties with or without reducing conditions. In undisturbed soils, the argic or natric horizon with the retic properties is typically overlain by an albic or cambic horizon. However, the overlying horizons may be lost due to erosion or ploughing.\n\n\n\n3.2.12 Shrink-swell cracks\n\nGeneral description\nShrink-swell cracks open and close due to shrinking and swelling of clay minerals with changing water content of the soil. They may be evident only when the soil is dry. They control the infiltration and percolation of water, even if they are filled with material from the surface.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nShrink-swell cracks occur in mineral material and:\n\nopen and close with changing water content of the soil; and\nare ≥ 0.5 cm wide, when the soil is dry, with or without infillings of material from the surface.\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nShrink-swell cracks are referred to in the diagnostic criteria of the protovertic horizon, the vertic horizon and in the Key to the Reference Soil Groups (where reference is made to their depth requirements).\n\n\n\n3.2.13 Sideralic properties\n\nGeneral description\nSideralic properties (from Greek sideros, iron, and Latin alumen, alum) refer to mineral material that has a relatively low CEC.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nSideralic properties occur in mineral material and require:\n\none or both of the following:\n\n≥ 8% clay and a CEC (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of &lt; 24 cmolc kg-1 clay; or\na CEC (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of &lt; 2 cmolc kg-1 soil; and\n\nevidence of soil formation as defined in criterion 3 of the cambic horizon.\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nSideralic properties are also present in ferralic horizons.\n\n\n\n3.2.14 Stagnic properties\n\nGeneral description\nStagnic properties (from Latin stagnare, to flood) form in layers that are, at least temporarily, saturated with stagnant water (or were saturated in the past, if now drained) for a period long enough to allow reducing conditions to occur (this may range from a few days in the tropics to a few weeks in other areas). In some soils with stagnic properties, the reducing conditions are caused by the intrusion of other liquids such as gasoline. If there are no more reducing conditions, the stagnic properties are relict.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nStagnic properties refer to mineral material, show redoximorphic features and comprise one or more of the following:\n\na layer that comprises reductimorphic features and soil material with the matrix colour and that shows both of the following:\n\nthe reductimorphic features are predominantly around biopores and, if soil aggregates are present, predominantly at the outer parts of the aggregates; and\nthe reductimorphic features have, compared against the matrix colour, the following Munsell colours, moist: a value ≥ 1 unit higher and a chroma ≥ 1 unit lower;\n\na layer that comprises oximorphic features and soil material with the matrix colour and that shows both of the following:\n\nthe oximorphic features are, if soil aggregates are present, predominantly inside the aggregates; and\nthe oximorphic features are black, surrounded by lighter-coloured material, or have, compared against the matrix colour, the following Munsell colours, moist: a hue ≥ 2.5 units redder and a chroma ≥ 1 unit higher; or\n\na layer that comprises reductimorphic features and oximorphic features (with or without soil material with a matrix colour) and that shows all of the following:\n\nthe reductimorphic features are predominantly around biopores and, if soil aggregates are present, predominantly at the outer parts of the aggregates; and\nthe oximorphic features are, if soil aggregates are present, predominantly inside the aggregates; and\nthe oximorphic features are black, surrounded by lighter-coloured material, or have, compared against the reductimorphic features, one or more of the following Munsell colours, all moist:\n\na hue ≥ 5 units redder; or\na chroma ≥ 4 units higher; or\na hue ≥ 2.5 units redder and a chroma ≥ 2 units higher; or\na hue ≥ 2.5 units redder, a value ≥ 1 unit lower and a chroma ≥ 1 unit higher; or\n\n\na layer with the colours of claric material in ≥ 95% of its exposed area, which is considered as reductimorphic feature, above an abrupt textural difference or above a layer with a bulk density of ≥ 1.5 kg dm-3; or\na combination of two layers: a layer with claric material in ≥ 95% of its exposed area, which is considered as reductimorphic feature, and a directly underlying layer fulfilling the diagnostic criteria 1, 2 or 3.\n\n\n\nField identification\nRedoximorphic features are described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.20).\n\n\nAdditional information\nStagnic properties result from a reduction of iron and/or manganese (hydr-)oxides around the larger pores. Mobilized Mn and Fe may be washed out laterally resulting in claric material (especially in the upper part of the profile that is coarser textured in many soils) or may migrate into the interiors of the soil aggregates where they are reoxidized (especially in the lower part of the profile).\nIf the stagnic properties are weakly expressed, the reductimorphic and oximorphic features cover only some parts of the exposed area, and the other parts show the original matrix colour that prevailed in the soil before the redox processes started. If the stagnic properties are strongly expressed, the entire exposed area of the fine earth shows either reductimorphic or oximorphic features.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nStagnic properties differ from gleyic properties. Stagnic properties are caused by stagnation of an intruding agent (mostly rainwater) that causes reducing conditions and that leads to an overlying Fe-poor layer and an underlying layer with oximorphic features inside the soil aggregates. (In some soils, only one of these layers is present.) Gleyic properties are caused by an upward moving agent (mostly groundwater) that causes reducing conditions and that leads to an underlying strongly reduced layer and an overlying layer with oximorphic features on or adjacent to the soil aggregate surfaces. (In some soils, only one of these layers is present.)\n\n\n\n3.2.15 Takyric properties\n\nGeneral description\nTakyric properties (from Turkic languages takyr, barren land) are related to a fine-textured surface crust with a platy or massive structure. They occur under arid conditions in periodically flooded soils.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nTakyric properties refer to a surface crust consisting of mineral material that has all of the following:\n\na texture class of clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay; and\na platy or massive structure; and\npolygonal cracks, ≥ 2 cm deep and with an average horizontal spacing of ≤ 20 cm, when the soil is dry; and\na rupture-resistance class of at least hard when dry and a plasticity of at least moderately plastic when moist; and\nan electrical conductivity (ECe) of the saturation extract of\n\n&lt; 4 dS m-1; or\nat least 1 dS m-1 less than that of the layer directly below the surface crust.\n\n\n\n\nField identification\nTakyric properties occur in depressions in arid regions, where surface water, rich in clay and silt but relatively low in soluble salts, accumulates and leaches salts out of the upper soil horizons. This causes clay dispersion and the formation of a thick, compact, fine-textured crust with prominent polygonal cracks when dry. The crust often contains ≥ 80% clay and silt. It is thick enough that it does not curl entirely upon drying.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nTakyric properties occur in association with many diagnostic horizons, the most important ones being the natric, salic, gypsic, calcic and cambic horizons. The low EC and low soluble-salt content of takyric properties set them apart from the salic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.2.16 Vitric properties\n\nGeneral description\nVitric properties (from Latin vitrum, glass) apply to layers that contain glass from volcanic or industrial origin and that contain a limited amount of short-range-order minerals or organo-metallic complexes.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nVitric properties require:\n\nin the fraction between &gt; 0.02 and ≤ 2 mm, ≥ 5% (by grain count) volcanic glass, glassy aggregates, other glass-coated primary minerals or glasses resulting from industrial processes; and\nan Alox + ½Feox value of ≥ 0.4%; and\na phosphate retention of ≥ 25%.\n\n\n\nField identification\nVitric properties can occur in a surface layer. However, they can also occur under some tens of centimetres of recent pyroclastic deposits. Layers with vitric properties can have an appreciable amount of organic matter. The sand and coarse silt fractions of layers with vitric properties have a significant amount of unaltered or partially altered volcanic glass, glassy aggregates, other glass-coated primary minerals or glasses resulting from industrial processes (coarser fractions may be checked by using a 10x hand lens; finer fractions may be checked by using a microscope).\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nVitric properties are, on the one hand, closely linked with andic properties, into which they may eventually develop. For some time during this development, a layer may show both the amount of volcanic glasses required for the vitric properties and the characteristics of andic properties. On the other hand, layers with vitric properties develop from tephric material. The diagnostic criteria of the vitric and andic properties are adapted after Shoji et al. (1996), Takahashi et al. (2004) and findings of the COST 622 Action (2004).\nChernic, mollic and umbric horizons may exhibit vitric properties as well.\n\n\n\n3.2.17 Yermic properties\n\nGeneral description\nYermic properties (from Spanish yermo, desert) are found on the mineral soil surface in deserts. They comprise features like desert pavement, desert varnish, ventifacts (windkanters), a platy structure and vesicular pores.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nYermic properties occur in mineral material and have one or both of the following:\n\ncoarse surface fragments covering ≥ 20% of the soil surface (desert pavement), underlain by a soil layer with an abundance of coarse fragments half or less the abundance of coarse surface fragments, and one or more of the following:\n\n≥ 10% of the coarse surface fragments, &gt; 2 cm (greatest dimension), are varnished; or\n≥ 10% of the coarse surface fragments, &gt; 2 cm (greatest dimension), are wind-shaped (ventifacts, windkanters); or\na surface layer, ≥ 1 cm thick, with a platy structure; or\na surface layer, ≥ 1 cm thick, with many vesicular pores; or\n\na surface layer, not compacted by human activity, ≥ 1 cm thick, with a platy structure and many vesicular pores.\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe features of the yermic properties are described in Annex 1:\ndesert pavement (Chapter 8.3.4)\ndesert varnish and ventifacts (Chapter 8.3.5)\nplaty structure (Chapter 8.4.10)\nvesicular pores (Chapter 8.4.12) - to be diagnostic, the vesicular pores must be present in the abundance class ‘many’.\nIf the texture is fine enough, the soil may show a polygonal network of desiccation cracks (Chapter 8.4.13), often filled with in-blown material, that extend into greater depths. In cold deserts, larger coarse fragments at the soil surface are often shattered by frost.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nYermic properties often occur in association with other diagnostics, characteristic for desert environments (salic, duric, gypsic, calcic and cambic horizons). In very cold deserts (e.g. Antarctica), they may occur associated with cryic horizons. Under these conditions, coarse cryoclastic material dominates, and there is little dust to be deflated and deposited by wind. Here, a dense pavement with varnish, ventifacts, aeolian sand layers and accumulations of soluble minerals may occur directly on loose deposits, without vesicular pores.",

    "text": "3.3 Diagnostic materials\nDiagnostic materials are materials that significantly influence soil-forming processes. Their characteristics may be inherited from the parent material or may be the result of soil-forming processes. Diagnostic materials do not describe parent material; they describe soil material, and the characteristics refer (as for all diagnostics) to the fine earth, unless stated otherwise. Their features can be observed or measured in the field or the laboratory and require a minimum or maximum expression to qualify as diagnostic. A minimum thickness is not part of the criteria.\n\n3.3.1 Aeolic material\n\nGeneral description\nAeolic material (from Greek aiolos, wind) describes material deposited by wind, typical in arid and semi-arid environments.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nAeolic material requires:\n\nevidence of wind deposition within 20 cm from the mineral soil surface by one or both of the following:\n\n10% of the particles of medium and coarse sand are rounded or subangular and have a matt surface, in some layer or in in-blown material filling cracks; or\naeroturbation (e.g. cross-bedding) in some layer; and\n\n&lt; 1% soil organic carbon from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 10 cm.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Artefacts\n\nGeneral description\nArtefacts describe human-made, human-altered and human-excavated material. They may by physically altered (e.g. broken to pieces) but are chemically and mineralogically not or only poorly altered and still largely recognizable.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nArtefacts (from Latin ars, art, and factus, made) are liquid or solid substances of any size that:\n\nare one or both of the following:\n\ncreated or substantially modified by humans as part of industrial or artisanal manufacturing processes; or\nbrought to the soil surface by human activity from a depth, where they were not influenced by surface processes, and deposited in an environment, where they do not commonly occur, with properties substantially different from the environment where they are placed; and\n\nhave substantially the same chemical and mineralogical properties as when first manufactured, modified or excavated.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\nExamples of artefacts are bricks, pottery, glass, crushed or dressed stone, wooden boards, industrial waste, plastic, garbage, processed oil products, bitumen, mine spoil and crude oil.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nTechnic hard material and geomembranes, intact, fractured or composed, also fulfil the diagnostic criteria of artefacts.\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Calcaric material\n\nGeneral description\nCalcaric material (from Latin calcarius, containing lime) refers to material that contains ≥ 2% calcium carbonate equivalent. The carbonates are at least partially inherited from the parent material (primary carbonates).\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nCalcaric material shows visible effervescence with 1 M HCl throughout the fine earth.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nCalcaric material may also meet the diagnostic criteria of protocalcic properties, which show discernible accumulations of secondary carbonates. Calcic and petrocalcic horizons have higher contents of carbonates and also show secondary carbonates. Petrocalcic horizons are continuously cemented.\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Claric material\n\nGeneral description\nClaric material (from Latin clarus, bright) is light-coloured fine earth.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nClaric material is mineral material and:\n\nhas in ≥ 90% of its exposed area a Munsell colour, dry, with one or both of the following:\n\na value of ≥ 7 and a chroma of ≤ 3; or\na value of ≥ 5 and a chroma of ≤ 2; and\n\nhas in ≥ 90% of its exposed area a Munsell colour, moist, with one or more of the following:\n\na value of ≥ 6 and a chroma of ≤ 4; or\na value of ≥ 5 and a chroma of ≤ 3; or\na value of ≥ 4 and a chroma of ≤ 2; or\nall of the following:\n\na hue of 5YR or redder; and\na value of ≥ 4 and a chroma of ≤ 3; and\n≥ 25% of the sand and coarse silt grains are uncoated.\n\n\n\n\n\nField identification\nIdentification in the field depends on soil colours. In addition, a 10x hand lens may be used to ascertain that sand and coarse silt grains are free of coatings (criterion 2.d). Claric material may exhibit a considerable shift in chroma when wetted.\n\n\nAdditional information\nThe presence of coatings around sand and coarse silt grains can be determined using an optical microscope for analysing thin sections. Uncoated grains usually show a very thin rim at their surface. Coatings may be of an organic nature, consist of iron oxides, or both, and are dark-coloured under translucent light. Iron coatings become reddish in colour under reflected light, while organic coatings remain brownish-black.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nThe claric material is used as a diagnostic criterion in the definition of the spodic horizon, the retic and the stagnic properties. A layer with claric material that has lost oxides and/or organic matter due to clay migration, podzolization or due to redox processes caused by stagnant water, forms an albic horizon.\n\n\n\n3.3.5 Dolomitic material\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nDolomitic material (named after the French geoscientist Déodat de Dolomieu) shows visible effervescence with heated 1 M HCl throughout the fine earth. It applies to material that contains ≥ 2% of a mineral that has a ratio CaCO3/MgCO3 &lt; 1.5. With non-heated HCl, it gives only a retarded and poorly visible effervescence.\n\n\n\n3.3.6 Fluvic material\n\nGeneral description\nFluvic material (from Latin fluvius, river) refers to fluviatile, marine and lacustrine sediments that receive fresh material or have received it in the past and still show stratification. Fluvic material shows only little soil formation after deposition.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nFluvic material is mineral material and:\n\nis of fluviatile, marine or lacustrine origin; and\nhas strata that are one or both of the following:\n\nobvious (including stratification tilted by cryogenic alteration) in ≥ 25% (by volume, related to the whole soil) over a specified depth; or\nevidenced by two or more layers with all of the following:\n\n≥ 0.2% soil organic carbon; and\na content of soil organic carbon ≥ 25% (relative) and ≥ 0.2% (absolute) higher than in the directly overlying layer; and\ndoes not form part of a natric or spodic horizon; and\n\n\none or both of the following:\n\nhas a single grain, a massive, a platy or a weak subangular blocky structure; or\nhas a granular or a subangular blocky structure in a layer that meets diagnostic criteria 2.b.\n\n\n\n\nField identification\nStratification may be reflected in different ways:\n\nvariation in texture and/or content or nature of coarse fragments\ndifferent colours related to the source materials\nalternating lighter- and darker-coloured soil layers, indicating an irregular decrease in soil organic carbon content with depth.\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nFluvic material is always associated with water bodies (e.g. rivers, lakes, the sea) and can therefore be distinguished from solimovic material. It may also fulfil the criteria of limnic material.\n\n\n\n3.3.7 Gypsiric material\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nGypsiric material (from Greek gypsos, gypsum) is mineral material that contains ≥ 5% gypsum that is not secondary gypsum.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nGypsiric material may also meet the diagnostic criteria of protogypsic properties, which show discernible accumulations of secondary gypsum. Gypsic and petrogypsic horizons also show secondary gypsum. Petrogypsic horizons have high amounts of gypsum and are continuously cemented.\n\n\n\n3.3.8 Hypersulfidic material\n\nGeneral description\nHypersulfidic material (from Greek hyper, over, and Latin sulpur, sulfur) contains inorganic sulfidic S and is capable of severe acidification as a result of the oxidation of inorganic sulfidic compounds contained within it. Hypersulfidic material is also known as ‘potential acid sulfate soil’.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nHypersulfidic material:\n\nhas ≥ 0.01% inorganic sulfidic S; and\nhas a pH (1:1 by mass in water, or in a minimum of water to permit measurement) of ≥ 4; and\nwhen a layer, 2–10 mm thick, is incubated aerobically at field capacity for 8 weeks, the pH drops to &lt; 4 and one or more of the following:\n\nwithin these 8 weeks, the total pH decline is ≥ 0.5 pH units; or\nlatest after these 8 weeks, the decrease in pH is only ≤ 0.1 pH units over a further period of 14 days; or\nlatest after these 8 weeks, the pH begins to increase again.\n\n\n\n\nField identification\nHypersulfidic material is seasonally or permanently waterlogged or forms under largely anaerobic conditions. It has a Munsell colour hue of N, 5Y, 5GY, 5BG, or 5G, a value of ≤ 4, and a chroma of 1, all moist. If the soil is disturbed, an odour of hydrogen sulfide (rotten eggs) may be noticed. This is accentuated by application of 1 M HCl.\nFor a quick screening test that is not definitive, a 10 g sample treated with 50 ml of 30% H2O2 will show a fall in pH to ≤ 2.5. Final assessment depends on incubation testing.\nCaution: H2O2 is a strong oxidant, and sulfides and organic matter will froth violently in a test tube that may become very hot.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nAcidification of hypersulfidic material usually causes the development of a thionic horizon. Hyposulfidic material has the same criteria for inorganic sulfidic S and for the pH value but is not capable of severe acidification.\n\n\n\n3.3.9 Hyposulfidic material\n\nGeneral description\nHyposulfidic material (from Greek hypo, under, and Latin sulpur, sulfur) contains inorganic sulfidic S and is not capable of severe acidification resulting from the oxidation of inorganic sulfidic compounds contained within it. Although oxidation does not lead to the formation of acid sulfate soils, hyposulfidic material is an important environmental hazard due to processes related to inorganic sulfides. Hyposulfidic material has a self-neutralizing capacity, usually due to the presence of calcium carbonate.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nHyposulfidic material:\n\nas ≥ 0.01% inorganic sulfidic S ; and\nhas a pH (1:1 by mass in water, or in a minimum of water to permit measurement) of ≥ 4; and\ndoes not consist of hypersulfidic material.\n\n\n\nField identification\nHyposulfidic material forms in similar environments to hypersulfidic material and morphologically may be indistinguishable from it. However, it is less likely to be coarse in texture. The hydrogen peroxide screening test (see hypersulfidic material) may also be indicative, but final assessment depends on incubation testing. Field tests for fine earth carbonate may be used to indicate whether the soil has some self-neutralizing capacity.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nAcidification of hyposulfidic material usually does not cause the development of a thionic horizon. Hypersulfidic material has the same criteria for inorganic sulfidic S and for the pH value but is capable of severe acidification.\n\n\n\n3.3.10 Limnic material\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nLimnic material (from Greek limnae, pool) includes both organic and mineral material and is one or more of the following:\n\ndeposited in water by precipitation, possibly in combination with sedimentation; or\nderived from algae; or\nderived from aquatic plants and subsequently transported; or\nderived from aquatic plants and subsequently modified by aquatic animals and/or microorganisms.\n\n\n\nField identification\nLimnic material is formed as subaquatic deposits and usually stratified. (After drainage it may occur at the soil surface.) Four types of limnic material can be distinguished:\n\nCoprogenous earth or sedimentary peat: organic, identifiable through many faecal pellets and peat residues, Munsell colour value of ≤ 4, moist, slightly viscous water suspension, a non-plastic or slightly plastic plasticity type, shrinking upon drying, difficult to rewet after drying, and cracking along horizontal planes.\nDiatomaceous earth: mainly diatoms (siliceous), identifiable by irreversible changing of the matrix colour (Munsell colour value of 3 to 5 in field moist or wet condition) upon drying as a result of the irreversibly shrinkage of the organic coatings on diatoms (use 440x microscope).\nMarl: strongly calcareous, identifiable by a Munsell colour value of ≥ 5, moist, and a reaction with 1 M HCl. The colour of marl usually does not change irreversibly upon drying.\nGyttja: small coprogenic aggregates, consisting of organic matter that has been strongly alterated by microorganisms, and minerals of predominantly clay to silt size, ≥ 0.5% soil organic carbon, a Munsell colour hue of 5Y, GY or G, moist, strong shrinkage after drainage and an rH value of ≥ 13.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.11 Mineral material\n\nGeneral description\nIn mineral material (from Celtic mine, mineral), the properties of the fine earth are dominated by mineral components.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nMineral material has\n\n&lt; 20% soil organic carbon (related to the fine earth plus the dead plant residues of any length and a diameter ≤ 5 mm); and\n&lt; 35% (by volume, related to the whole soil) artefacts containing ≥ 20% organic carbon.\n\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nMaterial that has ≥ 20% soil organic carbon is organic material. Other material that has ≥ 35% (by volume, related to the whole soil) artefacts containing ≥ 20% organic carbon is organotechnic material.\n\n\n\n3.3.12 Mulmic material\n\nGeneral description\nMulmic material (from German Mulm, powdery detritus) is mineral material developed from organic material. If water-saturated organic material is drained, a fast decomposition starts. While the amount of mineral components remains constant, the amount of organic matter decreases, and the organic matter content eventually falls below 20%, resulting in mineral material.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nMulmic material is mineral material that has developed from water-saturated organic material after drainage and that has:\n\n≥ 8% soil organic carbon; and\nsingle or in combination:\n\na single grain structure; or\na subangular or angular blocky structure with an average aggregate size of ≤ 2 cm; and\n\na Munsell colour chroma of ≤ 2, moist.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.13 Organic material\n\nGeneral description\nOrganic material (from Greek organon, tool) has large amounts of organic matter in the fine earth and/or contains many dead thin plant residues. It may show different stages of decomposition. If still connected to living plants (e.g. Sphagnum mosses), it may even be completely undecomposed. If derived from fallen organic residues, it is decomposed to at least the extent that it is not loose and/or that recognizable dead plant tissues comprise ≤ 90% of the volume (related to the fine earth plus all dead plant residues). Fallen organic residues with &gt; 90% recognizable dead plant tissues and still loose are called litter layer (see Chapter 2.1, General rules, and Annex 1, Chapters 8.3.1 and 8.3.2) and are not considered for classification in WRB. (Litter layers are temporally and spatially extremely variable in thickness). On the other hand, decomposition may be advanced until no recognizable dead plant tissues remain, and a homogeneous organic soil mass results. Organic material accumulates under both wet and dry conditions. The mineral component of the fine earth has a limited influence on soil properties.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nOrganic material\n\nhas ≥ 20% soil organic carbon (related to the fine earth plus the dead plant residues of any length and a diameter ≤ 5 mm); and\none or more of the following\n\ncontains ≤ 90% (by volume, related to the fine earth plus all dead plant residues) recognizable dead plant tissues or\nis not loose; or\nconsists of dead plant material still connected to living plants.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information\n20% organic carbon roughly corresponds to 40% organic matter. The remaining up to 60% consist of mineral components and/or of organic components that meet the criteria of artefacts.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nSoil organic carbon is organic carbon that does not meet the set of diagnostic criteria of artefacts. Material that has &lt; 20% soil organic carbon is either organotechnic or mineral material. Histic and folic horizons consist of organic material.\n\n\n\n3.3.14 Organotechnic material\n\nGeneral description\nOrganotechnic material (from Greek organon, tool, and technae, art) contains large amounts of organic artefacts. It contains relatively small amounts of soil organic carbon (organic carbon that does not meet the set of diagnostic criteria of artefacts).\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nOrganotechnic material has\n\n≥ 35% (by volume, related to the whole soil) artefacts containing ≥ 20% organic carbon; and\n&lt; 20% soil organic carbon (related to the fine earth plus the dead plant residues of any length and a diameter ≤ 5 mm).\n\n\n\nAdditional information\nExamples for organotechnic material are excavated coal, petroleum lenses, plastic, wooden boards and garbage like kitchen slops or baby nappies.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nMaterial with ≥ 20% soil organic carbon is organic material, irrespective of the other components. Material with &lt; 20% soil organic carbon and lower amounts of organic artefacts is mineral material.\n\n\n\n3.3.15 Ornithogenic material\n\nGeneral description\nOrnithogenic material (from Greek ornis, bird, and genesis, origin) is material with strong influence of bird excrements. It often has a high content of coarse fragments that have been transported by birds.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nOrnithogenic material has:\n\nremnants of birds or bird activity (bones, feathers, and sorted coarse fragments of similar size); and\n≥ 750 mg kg-1 P in the Mehlich-3 extract.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\n750 mg kg-1 P in the Mehlich-3 extract roughly correspond to 1090 mg kg-1 P or 2500 mg kg-1 P2O5 in 1% citric acid (Kabała et al. 2018), which was the requirement in former editions of WRB.\n\n\n\n3.3.16 Soil organic carbon\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nSoil organic carbon (from Greek organon, tool, and Latin carbo, coal) is organic carbon that does not meet the set of diagnostic criteria of artefacts.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nFor organic carbon meeting the criteria of artefacts, the Garbic or the Carbonic qualifier may apply.\n\n\n\n3.3.17 Solimovic material\n\nGeneral description\nSolimovic material (from Latin solum, soil, and movere, to move) is a heterogeneous mixture of material that has moved downslope, suspended in water. It is dominated by material that underwent soil formation at its original place, e.g. organic matter accumulation or the formation of Fe oxides. It has been transported as a result of erosional wash, and the transport may have been accelerated by land-use practices (e.g. deforestation, ploughing, downhill tillage, structure degradation). Solimovic material has been formed in relatively recent times (mostly Holocene). It normally accumulates in slope positions, in depressions or above a barrier on a low-grade slope. The barrier may be natural or human-made (e.g. hedge walls, terraces, benches). After deposition, there was no advanced soil formation.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nSolimovic material is mineral material and:\n\nis found on slopes, footslopes, toeslopes, fans, in depressions, above barriers, along gullies or similar relief positions, originating from upslope positions where it was subject to diffuse erosion; and\nis not of fluviatile, lacustrine, marine or mass movement origin; and\none or more of the following:\n\nif burying a mineral soil, it has a lower bulk density than the uppermost layer of the buried soil; or\nhas ≥ 0.6% soil organic carbon; or\nhas a Munsell colour chroma of ≥ 3, moist; or\ncontains artefacts and/or black carbon of any size; or\nhas ≥ 100 mg kg-1 P in the Mehlich-3 extract; and\n\ndoes not form part of a diagnostic horizon other than a cambic, chernic, mollic or umbric horizon.\n\n\n\nField identification\nThe fine earth of solimovic material can be of any particle size. Some small coarse fragments may be included. Solimovic material is generally imperfectly sorted. It may show some gross stratification, but stratification is not a typical feature due to the diffuse or chaotic nature of the deposition process. Solimovic material tends to occupy gently sloping to moderately steep sloping (2-30%) areas. Black carbon or small artefacts such as pieces of bricks, ceramics and glass may be present in solimovic material. In many cases, solimovic material has a lithic discontinuity at its base.\nThe upper part of the solimovic material shows characteristics (fine earth texture, colour, pH and soil organic carbon content) similar to the surface layer of the source in the neighbourhood. In extreme cases, the profile in the solimovic material mirrors the eroded soil profile of upward slope positions, with topsoil material buried under former subsoil material. Good indication in a landscape is varying colour of the soil surface between convex and concave positions.\n\n\nAdditional information\nAccumulations by rapid mass movements such as in landslides, slumps or tree throws do not meet the set of diagnostic criteria of solimovic material.\nIn agricultural environments, solimovic material has mostly a high base saturation. If not natural, this is the result of liming or fertilization before and/or after having been eroded.\nIn former editions of WRB, the solimovic material was called colluvic material. However, the traditional use of the word ‘colluvium’ is so different between countries and national traditions and changed so much over time (Miller and Juilleret 2020) that it is better to avoid this term and use a new one.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nSolimovic material is not associated with perennial water bodies (e.g. rivers, lakes, the sea) and can therefore be distinguished from fluvic material. However, in toeslope positions, fluvic and solimovic material may be sedimented alternatingly or grade into each other and may be difficult to differentiate.\nSolimovic material is not purposefully added as, e.g., the soil material in terric horizons.\n\n\n\n3.3.18 Technic hard material\n\nGeneral description\nTechnic hard material (from Greek technae, art) describes consolidated material, created or substantially modified by humans.\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nTechnic hard material:\n\nis consolidated material resulting from industrial or artisanal processes; and\nhas properties substantially different from those of natural materials; and\nis continuous or has free space covering &lt; 5% of its horizontal extension.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\nExamples of technic hard material are asphalt, concrete or a continuous layer of worked stones.\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nTechnic hard material, intact, fractured or composed, also fulfils the diagnostic criteria of artefacts.\n\n\n\n3.3.19 Tephric material\n\nGeneral description\nTephric material (from Greek tephra, pile ash) has many glasses in the fine earth. These consist of tephra (i.e. unconsolidated, unweathered or only slightly weathered pyroclastic products of volcanic eruptions), of tephric deposits (i.e. tephra that has been reworked and mixed with material from other sources, which includes tephric loess, tephric blown sand and volcanogenic alluvium) or of glasses resulting from industrial processes (e.g. ashes from power stations combusting coal or lignite).\n\n\nDiagnostic criteria\nTephric material has:\n\nin the fraction between &gt; 0.02 and ≤ 2 mm, ≥ 30% (by grain count) volcanic glass, glassy aggregates, other glass-coated primary minerals or glasses resulting from industrial processes; and\nno andic or vitric properties.\n\n\n\nAdditional information\nTephric material refers to the fine earth, but coarse fragments may also be present (including cinders, lapilli, pumice, pumice-like vesicular pyroclasts, blocks and volcanic bombs). The original description of the tephric material is based on Hewitt (1992), the amendment of artefacts is adapted from Uzarowicz et al. (2017).\n\n\nRelationships with some other diagnostics\nProgressive weathering of tephric material will lead to the formation of vitric properties. Glasses resulting from industrial processes fulfil the criteria of artefacts.\n\n\n\n\nAlmeida, Jaime Antonio de, Antônio Lunardi Neto, and Pablo Vidal-Torrado. 2015. “Sombric Horizon: Five Decades Without Evolution.” Scientia Agricola 72 (1): 87–95. https://doi.org/10.1590/0103-9016-2014-0111.\n\n\nAsiamah, R.

    "text": "8.1.1 Exploration of an area of interest with auger and spade\nSelect your area of interest and give it a distinct name, e.g., Gombori Pass. Then select a location. For further exploration, use a Pürckhauer or an Edelman auger. If using a Pürckhauer auger, drive it into the soil vertically with a plastic hammer. Occasionally, turn the auger with the help of the turning bar, especially in clay-rich soils. If the auger hits a rock or big stone, take it out. You may try again a small distance apart but be careful not to damage the auger. Drive the auger in to a depth of 1 m if possible. If not, note the actual depth that was reached. To take it out, turn it while pulling.\nNow place the auger onto the ground. Cut the protruding soil material with a knife and remove it to the side. Avoid contaminating one layer with the removed material from another. Be aware that compaction inside the auger may have occurred; the layer depths may therefore not be accurate. Place a folding ruler aside the auger according to the actually reached depth (Figure 8.2).\nIn most cases, the topsoil falls out of the auger. To investigate it in more detail, always make a mini-profile close to where the auger was driven in. It should be at least 25 cm deep and wide, and the profile walls should be vertical and smooth. Now place a folding ruler inside the profile in such a way that point 0 is at the soil surface (see Chapter 8.3.1). For later reconstruction, it may help to take a picture of the mini-profile (Figure 8.3).\nThe characteristics that can be described from the soil material in the auger are marked with an asterisk (*) in Chapter 8.4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: Pürckhauer auger profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Mini-profile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Preparation of a soil profile\nThe soil profile should be at least 1 m deep or reach the parent material. On a slope, unless the parent material starts at smaller depth, the profile depth (Figure 8.4) should be 1 m / cos(α). For the decision if the thickness and depth criteria of the WRB are fulfilled and when calculating element stocks (Prietzel and Wiesmeier 2019) the layer thickness perpendicular to the slope is needed. This is calculated multiplying the vertical thickness by cos(α).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Correct profile depth when terrain is inclined\n\n\n\nThe profile should be 1 m wide. If on a slope, the profile wall must be parallel to the contour lines. The material should be piled up to the left and/or right side of the profile and must not be placed on top side of the profile (the side of the profile wall). Never walk or place tools on the side of the profile wall. It is recommended to collect the soil material on two tarps, topsoil and subsoil separately. When refilling the soil profile later, you should first fill in the subsoil and then the topsoil.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: Ideal soil profile. Always take the photo perpendicular to the profile wall\n\n\n\n\n\nCarefully prepare the profile wall: it must be strictly vertical and smooth. Roots should be cut directly at the profile wall. Use an appropriate tool to clean the profile wall horizontally and avoid vertical smearing. Place the measuring tape in such a way that point 0 is at the soil surface (see Chapter 8.3.1). It should be at one side but not touch the side walls. It must be strictly vertical and plane. It may help to weight the bottom end of the tape with a stone or stick. Take a photo. Hold the camera perpendicularly to the profile wall (Figure 8.5). Avoid any inclination. Also take at least one picture of the surrounding terrain and vegetation (Figure 8.6), e.g., the tree canopy. Make sure you will be able to associate profile and photo later. If possible, save and name the pictures the same day they are taken.\nIf you describe a soil profile that has been dug some time ago, the topsoil may be disturbed. To describe the humus forms, you need a fresh miniprofile nearby the soil profile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: The setting of the profile in the landscape",

    "text": "8.3 Description of surface characteristics\nSurface characteristics can be detected on the soil surface without looking into a soil profile.\n\n8.3.1 Soil surface\nA litter layer is a loose layer that contains &gt; 90% (by volume, related to the fine earth plus all dead plant residues) recognizable dead plant tissues (e.g. undecomposed leaves). Dead plant material still connected to living plants (e.g. dead parts of Sphagnum mosses) is not regarded to form part of a litter layer. The soil surface (0 cm) is by convention the surface of the soil after removing, if present, the litter layer and, if present, below a layer of living plants (e.g. living mosses). The mineral soil surface is the upper limit of the uppermost mineral horizon (see Chapter 2.1, General rules, and see Chapter 8.4.4).\n\n\n8.3.2 Litter layer\nObserve an area of 5 m x 5 m with the profile at its centre. Report the percentage of the area covered and report the average and the maximum thickness of the litter layer in cm (see Chapter 8.3.1). If there is no litter layer, report 0 cm as thickness.\n\n\n8.3.3 Rock outcrops\nRock outcrops are exposures of bedrock. Observe an area (10 m x 10 m if possible) with the profile at its centre. Report the percentage of the area that is covered by rock outcrops. Also report in m the average distance between rock outcrops and their size (average length of the greatest dimension).\n\n\n8.3.4 Coarse surface fragments\nCoarse surface fragments are loose fragments lying at the soil surface, including those partially exposed. Observe an area (5 m x 5 m if possible) with the profile at its centre. The Table indicates the average length of the greatest dimension in cm.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.11: Size of coarse surface fragments, FAO (2006), Table 15\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize (cm)\nSize class\nCode\n\n\n\n\n&gt; 0.2 - 0.6\nFine gravel\nF\n\n\n&gt; 0.6 - 2\nMedium gravel\nM\n\n\n&gt; 2 - 6\nCoarse gravel\nC\n\n\n&gt; 6 - 20\nStones\nS\n\n\n&gt; 20 - 60\nBoulders\nB\n\n\n&gt; 60\nLarge boulders\nL\n\n\n\nNo coarse surface fragments\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport the total percentage of the area that is covered by coarse surface fragments. In addition, report at least one and up to three size classes and report the percentage of the area that is covered by the coarse surface fragments of the respective size class, the dominant one first.\n\n\n8.3.5 Desert features\nCoarse fragments that are constantly exposed to wind-blown sand may be affected by abrasion, etching and polishing, which results in even surfaces with sharp edges. These fragments are called ventifacts (windkanters), and their totality is called desert pavement. Observe an area of 5 m x 5 m with the profile at its centre and report the percentage of ventifacts out of the coarse fragments &gt; 2 cm (greatest dimension).\nCoarse fragments may show chemical weathering, which may lead to the formation of oxides and an intense colour at their upper surfaces, whereas there is no such weathering and therefore the original rock colour at their lower surfaces. This intense colour at the upper surfaces is called desert varnish. Observe an area of 5 m x 5 m with the profile at its centre and report the percentage of coarse fragments &gt; 2 cm (greatest dimension) featuring desert varnish.\n\n\n8.3.6 Patterned ground\nPatterned ground is the result of material sorting due to freeze-thaw cycles in permafrost regions. Report the sorting of coarse fragments &gt; 6 cm (greatest dimension) at the soil surface.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.12: Patterned ground\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForm\nCode\n\n\n\n\nRings\nR\n\n\nPolygons\nP\n\n\nStripes\nS\n\n\nNone\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.7 Surface crusts\nSurface crusts are described as layers in Chapter 8.4.31 and further explained there. The area covered is described here. Observe an area (5 m x 5 m if possible) with the profile at its centre. Report the percentage of the area that has a surface crust.\n\n\n8.3.8 Surface cracks\nCracks are fissures other than those attributed to soil structure (see Chapter 8.4.10). If surface cracks are present, report the average width of the cracks. If the soil surface between cracks of larger width classes is regularly divided by cracks of smaller width classes, report the two width classes. If different width classes occur randomly, just report the dominant one. The continuity of cracks to a greater depth is reported with the layer description (see Chapter 8.4.13). For every width class, report the average distance between the cracks and the spatial arrangement and persistence of the cracks.\n\nWidth\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.13: Width of surface cracks, FAO (2006), Table 21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWidth (cm)\nWidth class\nCode\n\n\n\n\n≤ 1\nVery fine\nVF\n\n\n&gt; 1 - 2\nFine\nFI\n\n\n&gt; 2 - 5\nMedium\nME\n\n\n&gt; 5 - 10\nWide\nWI\n\n\n&gt; 10\nVery wide\nVW\n\n\n\nNo surface cracks\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance between surface cracks\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.14: Distance between surface cracks, FAO (2006), Table 21, modified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance (cm)\nDistance class\nCode\n\n\n\n\n≤ 0.5\nTiny\nTI\n\n\n&gt; 0.5 - 2\nVery small\nVS\n\n\n&gt; 2 - 5\nSmall\nSM\n\n\n&gt; 5 - 20\nMedium\nME\n\n\n&gt; 20 - 50\nLarge\nLA\n\n\n&gt; 50 - 200\nVery large\nVL\n\n\n&gt; 200 - 500\nHuge\nHU\n\n\n&gt; 500\nVery huge\nVH\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial arrangement of surface cracks\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.15: Spatial arrangement of surface cracks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial arrangement\nCode\n\n\n\n\nPolygonal\nP\n\n\nNon-polygonal\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPersistence of surface cracks\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.16: Persistence of surface cracks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nCode\n\n\n\n\nReversible (open and close with changing moisture, e.g., in Vertisols and in soils with the Vertic or the Protovertic qualifier)\nR\n\n\nIrreversible (persist year-round, e.g., drained polder cracks, cracks in cemented layers)\nI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.9 Presence of water\nReport the presence of water above the soil surface.

    "text": "8.4 Description of layers\n\n8.4.1 Identification of layers and layer depths\nA soil layer is a zone in the soil, approximately parallel to the soil surface, with properties different from layers above and/or below it. If at least one of these properties is the result of soil-forming processes, the layer is called a soil horizon. In the following, the term ‘layer’ is preferred to include layers, in which soilforming processes did not occur.\nA soil layer is identified by certain observable characteristics. Among these characteristics are:\n\nMatrix colour\nRedoximorphic features\nTexture\nCoarse fragments\nArtefacts\nBulk density\nStructure\nCoatings and bridges\nCracks\nCarbonates\nSecondary carbonates\nSecondary gypsum\nSecondary silica\nCementation\nWater saturation\nVolcanic glasses\nCorg content\nHuman alterations\n\nWherever you observe a major difference in at least one of these characteristics, set a layer boundary. Whenever a layer is too thick (e.g. &gt; 30 cm), it may be wise to subdivide it into two or more layers of more or less equal thickness for description. In certain soils, it may also be wise to add additional layer limits at depths, which you may need to check for the presence or absence of a diagnostic horizon (e.g. 20 cm to check mollic or umbric horizons). Alluvial sediments and tephra layers may be finely stratified. It may be appropriate to combine several such strata to one layer for description. In all other cases, different geological strata must not be combined to one layer.\nIn the following headings, the (o), the (m), and the (o, m) indicate, whether the described characteristic has to be reported in organic or in mineral layers or in both (see Chapter 8.4.4). For organotechnic layers, the user decides, which characteristics have to be described. The asterisk (*) informs that the characteristic can also be reported in a Pürckhauer auger.\nThe layers are numbered consecutively from the soil surface (see Chapter 8.3.1) downwards. Report the upper and lower depth for every layer. If the lower depth of the last layer is unknown, report the depth of the profile with the + symbol as the layer’s lower depth.\nThe following principles have to be considered for description (see General rules, Chapter 2.1):\n\nAll data refer to the fine earth, unless stated otherwise. The fine earth comprises the soil constituents ≤ 2 mm. The whole soil comprises fine earth, coarse fragments, artefacts, cemented parts, and dead plant residues of any size.\nAll data are given by mass, unless stated otherwise.\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Homogeneity of the layer (o, m)\n\nLayer consisting of different parts\nIf a layer consists of two or more different parts that do not form horizontal layers but can easily be distinguished, describe them separately. Use separate lines in the Soil Description Sheet (Annex 4, Chapter 11) and report the percentage (by exposed area, related to the whole soil) of each part. Examples are layers with retic properties (see Chapter 8.4.18), with cryogenic alteration (see Chapter 8.4.34) or with remodelling by single ploughing (see Chapter 8.4.39). The separation is not recommended, if there is just a wavy boundary (as typical, e.g., for chernic horizons or for eluvial horizons in Podzols, see Chapter 8.4.5) or if there are just some additions of materials (see Chapter 8.4.39).\n\n\nLayer composed of several strata of alluvial sediments or of tephra\nAlluvial strata comprise fluviatile, lacustrine and marine deposits. Tephra strata have a significant amount of pyroclasts. Report the presence of alluvial strata and of tephra strata within the described layer.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.26: Presence of strata within a layer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nCode\n\n\n\n\nLayer is composed of two or more alluvial strata\nA\n\n\nLayer is composed of two or more tephra strata\nT\n\n\nLayer is composed of two or more alluvial strata containing tephra\nB\n\n\nLayer is not composed of different strata\nN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.3 Water\n\nWater saturation (o, m)\nReport the water saturation.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.27: Types of water saturation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nCode\n\n\n\n\nSaturated by seawater for ≥ 30 consecutive days\nMS\n\n\nSaturated by seawater according to tidal changes\nMT\n\n\nSaturated by groundwater or flowing water for ≥ 30 consecutive days with water that has an electrical conductivity of ≥ 4 dS m-1\nGS\n\n\nSaturated by groundwater or flowing water for ≥ 30 consecutive days with water that has an electrical conductivity of &lt; 4 dS m-1\nGF\n\n\nSaturated by rainwater for ≥ 30 consecutive days\nRA\n\n\nSaturated by water from melted ice for ≥ 30 consecutive days\nMI\n\n\nFormerly water-saturated for ≥ 30 consecutive days, then drained and now water-saturated for &lt; 30 consecutive days\nDR\n\n\nPure water, covered by floating organic material\nPW\n\n\nNone of the above\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil water status (m) (*)\nCheck the soil water status of non-saturated layers.

Otherwise, it is called terrestrial. Hydromorphic organic layers comprise peat and organic limnic material. Report, whether a layer is organic, organotechnic or mineral and, if organic or organotechnic, whether it is hydromorphic or terrestrial. The distinction is preliminary and may have to be corrected according to laboratory analyses.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.29: Organic (hydromorphic and terrestrial), organotechnic and mineral layers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nCode\n\n\n\n\nOrganic hydromorphic\nOH\n\n\nOrganic terrestrial\nOT\n\n\nOrganotechnic hydromorphic\nTH\n\n\nOrganotechnic terrestrial\nTT\n\n\nMineral\nMI\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.5 Layer boundaries (o, m)\n\nDistinctness of the layer’s lower boundary (*)\nReport the distinctness of the layer’s lower boundary.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.30: Distinctness of layer boundaries, Schoeneberger et al.

If this is, at least partially, the result of soil-forming processes, it is called soil structure. Otherwise, it is rock structure. Structure refers to the fine earth. Structure is reported for mineral layers. Additionally, structure is reported for drained hydromorphic organic layers.\nA soil aggregate is a discrete structural body that can be clearly distinguished from its surroundings and that results from soil-forming processes. If a force is applied to a specimen, and the specimen breaks along natural surfaces of weakness, it is composed of aggregates. If the specimen breaks exactly where force is applied, the structure is massive (coherent). If there is no coherence between the particles, the structure is of single-grain type. Human disturbance may create artificial structural elements, which are called clods.\nUndisturbed aggregates or non-aggregated structure are called the first-level structure. A massive layer or aggregates of the types subangular blocky, angular blocky, polyhedral, lenticular, platy, wedge-shaped, prismatic, and columnar may break into aggregates of a second-level structure and even further into aggregates of a third-level structure. The second-level and the third-level structure may be of the same type(s) as the first-level structure or of a different one.\nUse the spade, take out a large sample, make sure that the aggregates of the first-level structure, if present, are undisturbed, and observe the structure. Report the type, if present, up to three, the dominant one first. For aggregates and artificial structural elements, report grade, penetrability for roots, and size class, for each type separately. If applicable, report two size classes, the dominant one first. Report for every type and size class the abundance (as percentage by volume of the layer).\nFrom the first-level structure, take some specimens from each type (if more than one size class of a type is present, take only the greater one) and try to break them with low forces. If aggregates of a second-level structure appear, report the type, if present, up to two, the dominant one first. For each type, report separately grade, size class, and penetrability for roots. If applicable, report two size classes, the dominant one first. Report for every type and size class the abundance (as percentage by volume of the respective first level structure).\nFrom the second-level structure, take some specimens from each type (if more than one size class of a type is present, take only the greater one) and try to break them with low forces. If aggregates of a third-level structure appear, report type, grade, size class, and penetrability for roots. If applicable, report two size classes, the dominant one first. Report for every size class the abundance (as percentage by volume of the respective second level structure).\n\nTypes\nFigure 8.15 explains some general terms of soil aggregate description.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.15: General terms of soil aggregate description\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.41: Types of structure, descriptions, Schoeneberger et al, (2012), 2-53, FAO (2006), Table 49, National Committee on Soil and Terrain (2009), 171-181, modified\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranular\n\n\nSpheroidal;\n\nbiogenic;

Take a fresh sample, slightly crush it and observe the colour in the shade (both your eyes and the colour chart in the shade) and not in the twilight. Report hue, value and chroma. The matrix colour and the colour of reductimorphic features are recorded twice, moist and (if possible) dry, the other colours only in the moist state. The moist state corresponds to field capacity, which is obtained with sufficient accuracy by moistening and reading the colour as soon as visible moisture films have disappeared.\n\n\n8.4.17 Matrix colour (m) (*)\nReport the colour of the soil matrix. If there is more than one matrix colour, report up to three, the dominant one first, and give the percentage of the exposed area.\nAdvanced chemical weathering without physical alteration, especially without turbation, results in saprolite (see Chapter 8.4.10). According to the minerals present, a colour pattern may result. These colours are reported as matrix colours.\n\n\n8.4.18 Combinations of darker-coloured finer-textured and lighter-coloured coarser-textured parts (m)\nIf a layer consists of darker-coloured finer-textured and lighter-coloured coarser-textured parts that do not form horizontal layers but can easily be distinguished, describe them separately. Use separate lines in the Soil Description Sheet (Annex 4, Chapter 11) and give a full description. The principal colours are regarded to be matrix colours.\nFor the coarser-textured parts, report in addition the following characteristics:\n\nthe percentage (by exposed area) occupied by coarser-textured parts of any orientation (vertical, horizontal, inclined) having a width of ≥ 0.5 cm\nthe percentage (by exposed area) occupied by continuous vertical tongues of coarser-textured parts with a horizontal extension of ≥ 1 cm (if these tongues are absent, report 0%)\nthe depth range in cm, where these tongues cover ≥ 10% of the exposed area (if they extend across serveral layers, the length is only reported in the description of that layer, where they start at the layer’s upper limit).\n\nIn the middle of the layer, prepare a horizontal surface, 50 cm x 50 cm, and report the percentage (by horizontal area covered) of the coarser-textured parts.\n\n\n8.4.19 Lithogenic variegates (m)\nReport colour, size class, and abundance.

Oximorphic features show the accumulation of substances in oxidized state (concentrations) and usually have a redder hue, a higher chroma and a lower value than the surrounding material, while reductimorphic features show the opposite characteristics. Soil parts showing reductimorphic features may either contain substances in reduced state or may have lost them.\nReport substance, location, size class (up to two, the dominant one first), cementation class and abundance for each colour separately, for up to three colours, the dominant one first. Substance for oximorphic features is always reported, for reductimorphic features only in some cases. Size class is only reported for oximorphic features inside soil aggregates. Cementation is only reported for oximorphic features. The abundance is reported as percentage of the exposed area.\n\nColour (*)\nReport the colour according to the Munsell Color Charts.

Report them as percentage of the exposed area (related to the fine earth plus oximorphic features of any size and any cementation class).\n\n\nAbundance of cemented oximorphic features (by volume, related to the whole soil)\nThis paragraph refers to cemented oximorphic features with a cementation class of at least moderately cemented and a diameter of &gt; 2 mm. They comprise concretions and nodules (see above) and remnants of a broken-up layer that has been cemented by Fe oxides. Report the abundance as percentage by volume (related to the whole soil).\n\n\n\n8.4.21 Redox potential and reducing conditions (o, m)\nThe soil redox potential (Eh) expresses the ratio of the concentrations of oxidized and reduced substances and is measured in millivolts (mV). In soils, redox potentials range from +800 mV to –350 mV. A low redox potential indicates strong reducing conditions. When opening a profile pit, oxygen gets access to the profile wall, which leads to a rapid oxidation of the exposed reduced substances and to a subsequent change of the redox potential at the profile wall.\n\nMeasure the redox potential and calculate the rH value\nFor measuring the redox potential (Blume, Stahr, and Leinweber 2010; UN-FAO 2006), the following equipment is needed:\n\na pointed stainless-steel rod of 4-5 mm in diameter, long enough to reach the desired soil depth\na perforated plastic tube of 15-20 mm in diameter and of a length corresponding to the depth of measurement\nconcentrated KCl solution, fixed with agar\na Pt electrode\na reference electrode, e.g., with Ag/AgCl in 1 M KCl or with calomel (as used for measuring the pH value)\na potentiometer.\n\nProcedure: Step 1 - 2 m aside the profile pit and drive the rod into the soil down to the desired depth, roughen the Pt electrode with fine-grained sandpaper, intrude it immediately into the hole and press it against the soil. Make another hole at 10-20 cm distance, wide and deep enough to place a plastic tube that is some cm longer than the depth of the Pt electrode. Fill the tube with the fixed KCl solution, place the tube into the hole and fix it with soil material. Then, place the reference electrode into the KCl solution. Connect the electrodes with the potentiometer and read the voltage after 30 minutes. Repeat readings every 10 minutes until the value is stable. In some cases, this may take several hours. At least two replicates are recommended. (If you dispose of more than one set of equipment, you may measure the redox potential simultaneously at different soil depths.) The obtained voltage has to be adjusted to the voltage of the standard hydrogen electrode: for Ag/AgCl in 1 M KCl add +244 mV, for calomel add +287 mV. Simultaneously, measure the pH value (see Chapter 8.4.29) of the soil at the profile wall in distilled water (soil:water = 1:5) at the same depth. Report the rH value that is calculated with the following equation: \\(rH = (2 Eh \\div 59) + 2 pH\\)\nNote: If the profile is freshly dug and not too sandy, you may also place the electrodes horizontally at least 15 cm behind in the profile wall.\n\n\nEstimate the rH value (*)\nThe following field tests are available to prove reducing conditions:\n\nMethane can be lit with a match.\nH2S is formed when spraying a soil sample with a 10% HCl solution and can be identified by the odour of rotten eggs.\nFe2+ can be proven by oxidation with a 0.2% (mass by volume) solution of α,α-dipyridyl dissolved in 1 N ammonium acetate (NH4OAc), pH 7. Take a soil sample and spray it with the solution. If Fe2+ is present, a strong red colour will develop. The test needs a freshly broken sample that has not yet been oxidized at the open profile wall. In neutral to alkaline soils, the colour is hardly visible. Caution: The solution is slightly toxic.\n\nThe following Table explains how to estimate the rH value using these field tests and the observed redoximorphic features (see Chapter 8.4.20). Report the rH range. Note that oximorphic features may be relic. Reductimorphic features may also be relic, if Fe and Mn have been removed in reduced form leaving behind a layer virtually free of Fe and Mn.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.59: Ranges of rH values and related soil processes as derived from redoximorphic features and from field tests of reducing conditions, Blume et al.

If the weathering is initial, the Fe oxides may be concentrated in soil parts with easy access to oxygen, e.g. along pores. These parts have a distinctly redder hue or stronger chroma. Report the abundance as percentage of the exposed area.\n\n\n8.4.23 Coatings and bridges (m)\n\nClay coatings and clay bridges\nIlluviated clay consists of clay minerals, mostly together with oxides and in many cases together with organic matter. It covers surfaces of soil aggregates, coarse fragments and biopore walls as coatings (argillans), or it forms bridges between sand grains. The clay minerals give the coatings a shiny appearance. The oxides provide a colour that is more intensive (usually a higher Munsell chroma) than the colour of the matrix; organic matter provides a darker colour (usually a lower Munsell value) than the colour of the matrix (see Chapter 8.4.17). A hand lens (maximum 10x) may be helpful.\nReport the abundance of\n\nclay coatings in % of the surfaces of soil aggregates, coarse fragments and/or biopore walls\nclay bridges between sand grains in % of involved sand grains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.19: Clay coatings and clay bridges, Schoeneberger et al. , 2-34\n\n\n\n\n\nOrganic matter coatings and oxide coatings on sand and coarse silt grains\nSand and coarse silt grains are mostly coated by organic matter and/or oxides.

This method detects primary and secondary calcium carbonates. Contrary to calcium carbonate, dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) shows little reaction with cold HCl. To identity dolomite, put some soil material in a spoon, add drops of 1 M HCl and heat it with a lighter underneath.

They are more soluble than gypsum. The presence of readily soluble salts is checked by measuring the electrical conductivity in the saturation extract (ECe). In the saturation extract, the soil is completely moist, but has no visible water surplus. This is not easy to achieve.\nAlternatively, one can measure the electrical conductivity in an extract of 10 g soil with 25 ml aqua dest. (EC2.5). Mix soil and water carefully, let it rest for at least 30 minutes and measure the electrical conductivity in the clear solution in dS m-1. It must then be transformed into the ECe according to the following equation: \\(EC_{e} = 250 \\times EC_{2.5} \\times (WC_{e})^{-1}\\)\nWCe is the water content in the saturation extract. It can be estimated in mineral soils from texture (see Chapter 8.4.9) and Corg content (see Chapter 8.4.36) and in peat soils from the degree of decomposition (see Chapter 8.4.41) with the help of the following Tables. High amounts of coarse fragments reduce the water content.\nReport the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract in dS m-1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.69: Estimation of the water content of the saturation extract of mineral layers, DVWK (1995), FAO (2006), Table 43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexture class\n\nWater content of the saturation extract (WCSE) (g water / 100 g soil) by Corg content (%)\n\n\n\n&lt; 0.25\n0.25 - &lt; 0.5\n0.5 - &lt; 1\n1 - &lt; 2\n2 - &lt; 4\n4 - &lt; 20\n\n\n\n\nCS\n5\n6\n8\n13\n21\n35\n\n\nMS\n8\n9\n11\n16\n24\n38\n\n\nFS, VFS\n10\n11\n13\n18\n26\n40\n\n\nLS, SL (&lt; 10% clay)\n14\n15\n17\n22\n30\n45\n\n\nSiL (&lt; 10% clay)\n17\n18\n20\n25\n34\n49\n\n\nSi\n19\n20\n22\n27\n36\n51\n\n\nSL (≥ 10% clay)\n22\n23\n26\n31\n39\n55\n\n\nL\n25\n26\n29\n34\n42\n58\n\n\nSiL (≥ 10% clay)\n28\n29\n32\n37\n46\n62\n\n\nSCL\n32\n33\n36\n41\n50\n67\n\n\nCL, SiCL\n44\n46\n48\n53\n63\n80\n\n\nSC\n51\n53\n55\n60\n70\n88\n\n\nSiC, C (&lt; 60% clay)\n63\n65\n68\n73\n82\n102\n\n\nC (≥ 60% clay)\n105\n107\n110\n116\n126\n147\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.70: Estimation of the water content of the saturation extract of organic layers, DVWK (1995), FAO (2006), Table 43\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegree of decomposition\n(by volume, related to the fine earth plus all dead plant residues)\nWater content of the saturation extract (WCSE) (g water / 100 g soil)\n\n\n\n\nThe organic material consists only of recognizable dead plant tissues\n80\n\n\nAfter rubbing, &gt; three fourths, but not all, of the organic material consist of recognizable dead plant tissues\n120\n\n\nAfter rubbing, ≤ three fourths and &gt; two thirds of the organic material consist of recognizable dead plant tissues\n170\n\n\nAfter rubbing, ≤ two thirds and &gt; one sixth of the organic material consist of recognizable dead plant tissues\n240\n\n\nAfter rubbing, ≤ one sixth of the organic material consists of recognizable dead plant tissues\n300\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.29 Field pH (o, m)\nReport the field pH. For its determination, two different methods are recommended: the colorimetric and the potentiometric method. The colorimetric method only allows the pH measurement in distilled water, while the potentiometric method allows the measurement in different solutions.\n\nColorimetric method\nMix soil and distilled water in a 1:1 ratio (volume:volume) and stir the mixture thoroughly. Allow the mixture to settle until a supernatant forms. Submerge an indicator paper in the supernatant and report the result.\n\n\nPotentiometric method\nTable 8.71 shows common solutions and mixing ratios. Mix air-dry soil with the solution thoroughly. Allow the mixture to settle until a supernatant forms. Measure the pH value with a pH electrode, ideally with the help of a tripod. Wait until the measured value is steady.

This Chapter refers to the consistence of the matrix and of non-redoximorphic features. For the consistence of redoximorphic features, see Chapter 8.4.20. Consistence is reported separately for cemented and non-cemented (parts of) layers. If a specimen of soil does not fall into pieces by applying low forces, one has to check, whether it is cemented.\n\nPresence and volume of cementation\nCementation by ice is obvious. For checking cementation by other agents, different specimens have to be taken, depending on soil characteristics. For checking surface crusts and platy aggregates, take a specimen that is approximately 1 to 1.5 cm long by 0.5 cm thick (or the thickness of occurrence, if &lt; 0.5 cm thick). In all other cases, take a specimen, around 2.6 to 3 cm long at all dimensions. Take the specimen air-dried and submerge it in water for at least 1 hour. If it slakes like forming a soup, it is not cemented. Otherwise, it is cemented. Report the percentage (by volume, related to the whole soil) of the layer that is cemented.\n\n\nCementing agents (cemented soil)\nReport the cementing agents. If more than one is present, report up to three, the dominant one first. The term ‘oxides’, as used here, includes hydroxides and oxide-hydroxides.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.72: Cementing agents, Schoeneberger et al.

For checking surface crusts and platy aggregates, take a specimen that is approximately 1 to 1.5 cm long by 0.5 cm thick (or the thickness of occurrence, if &lt; 0.5 cm thick) and apply force perpendicular to its greatest dimension. In all other cases, take a specimen, around 2.6 to 3 cm long at all dimensions, and apply force. Observe the force needed for failure and report the cementation class (cemented soil) or the rupture resistance class (non-cemented soil). The rupture resistance has to be detected in moist soil and, if possible, also in dry soil. If specimens of the required size are not obtainable, use the following equation to calculate the stress at failure (Table 8.73 and Table 8.74) (Schoeneberger et al. 2012):\n\\((2.8 \\text{cm} \\div \\text{cube length cm})^{2} \\times (\\text{estimated stress (N) at failure})\\)\ne.g. for a 5.6-cm cube \\([(2.8 \\div 5.6)^{2} \\times 20 N] = 5 N\\) → Very friable (moist).\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.73: Cementation, Schoeneberger et al.

Non-cemented soil should be at field capacity for measurement. Use a penetrometer and report the penetration resistance in MPa. The measurement should be repeated at least five times to calculate a reliable average value.\n\n\n\n8.4.31 Surface crusts (m)\nA crust is a thin layer of soil constituents bound together into a horizontal mat or into small polygonal plates (see Schoeneberger et al. 2012). Soil crusts develop in the first mineral layer(s) and are formed by a sealing agent of physical, chemical and/or biological origin. The characteristics of the crust are different from the underlying layers. Typically, soil crusts change the infiltration rate and stabilize loose soil aggregates. They may be present permanently or only when the soil is dry. The area covered is reported in Chapter 8.3.7. They may be cemented or not, which is reported in Chapter 8.4.30.\nReport the sealing agent. If more than one is present, report up to three, the dominant one first.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.78: Sealing agent of surface crusts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nCode\n\n\n\n\nPhysical, permanent\nPP\n\n\nPhysical, only when dry\nPD\n\n\nChemical, by carbonates\nCC\n\n\nChemical, by gypsum\nCG\n\n\nChemical, by readily soluble salts\nCR\n\n\nChemical, by silica\nCS\n\n\nBiological, by cyanobacteria\nBC\n\n\nBiological, by algae\nBA\n\n\nBiological, by fungi\nBF\n\n\nBiological, by lichens\nBL\n\n\nBiological, by mosses\nBM\n\n\nNo crust present\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.32 Continuity of hard materials and cemented layers (m)\nContinuous rock, technic hard material and cemented layers may have fractures, which are filled by non-cemented soil material. Report the total percentage (by volume, related to the whole soil) that is occupied by the fractures and the average distance between the fractures in cm. This has also to be reported, if the hard or cemented material starts at the soil surface. If a cemented layer is not only fractured but broken up, the remnants are reported with the coarse fragments (see Chapter 8.4.7).\n\n\n8.4.33 Volcanic glasses and andic characteristics (o, m)\n\nVolcanic glasses in the sand and coarse silt fraction\nReport the percentage of the particles in the sand and coarse silt fraction (&gt; 20 μm - ≤ 2 mm) that consist of volcanic glasses.

In the field, one can recognize a low bulk density, a dark colour and a high organic matter content. In addition, there are two specific field tests indicative of andic properties.\nThixotropy: Layers with andic properties show a high variable charge allowing the absorption of much water that can easily be driven out by shaking but will be absorbed again, after a while. Procedure: Take a soil sample and make a sphere of about 2.5 cm in diameter. Wait until any moisture films have disappeared. Place the sphere in cupped hands and shake it. If moisture films appear at the surface of the sphere, the soil shows thixotropy. After a while, the moisture films will disappear again.\nNaF test according to Fieldes and Perrott (1966), after FAO (2006): A pHNaF of ≥ 9.5 indicates the presence of abundant allophanes and imogolites and/or organo-aluminium complexes. Aluminium sorbs F- ions while releasing OH- ions. The test is indicative for most layers with andic properties, except for those very rich in organic matter. However, the same reaction occurs in spodic horizons and in acidic clayey soils that are rich in aluminium-interlayered clay minerals; soils with free carbonates also react. Before applying the NaF test, check the soil pH in water or KCl (the NaF test is not suitable for alkaline soils) and the presence of free carbonates (using the HCl test). Procedure: Place a small amount of soil on a filter paper previously soaked in phenolphthalein and add some drops of 1 M NaF (adjusted to pH 7.5). A positive reaction is indicated by a fast change to an intense red colour. Alternatively, measure the pH of a suspension of 1 g soil in 50 ml 1 M NaF (adjusted to pH 7.5) after waiting 2 minutes. A pH of &gt; 9.5 is an indication of andic properties.\nReport the results.\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.80: Thixotropy and NaF field test\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCriterion\nCode\n\n\n\n\nPositive NaF test\nNF\n\n\nThixotropy\nTH\n\n\nPositive NaF test and Thixotropy\nNT\n\n\nNone of the above\nNO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.34 Permafrost features (o, m)\n\nCryogenic alteration\nEstimate the total percentage (by exposed area, related to the whole soil) affected by cryogenic alteration.

    "section": "8.5 Sampling",
    "text": "8.5 Sampling\nWe describe here the sampling of the terrestrial organic surface layers and the conventional and volumetric sampling of mineral layers, all for the standard analyses described in Annex 2 (Chapter 9). Sampling of other layers requires special techniques that are not described here.\n\n8.5.1 Preparation of sampling bags\nUse strong, moisture-resistant bags (transparent, if possible) for sampling. Write the sampling details twice: once on the bag and once on a piece of paper to be put into the bag. If you want to transfer sampling rings to the laboratory, write the sampling details on the ring. Always use a permanent marker.\nWrite down the following details:\n\nProfile name\nConventional (C) / Volumetric (V)\nLayer upper and lower depth\nLayer designation (see Annex 3, Chapter 10).\n\nExample: Gombori Pass 1 - V - 0-10 cm - Ah.\nMake sure to seal the bags after filling in the sample.\n\n\n8.5.2 Sampling of organic layers\nGenerally, the fine earth plus all dead plant residues are sampled. For the decision if a layer consists of organic material, the organic carbon is measured in a sample containing the fine earth plus the dead plant residues of any length and a diameter ≤ 5 mm (excluding artefacts).\nFor sampling the terrestrial organic surface layers, use a quadratic steel frame, for instance with 30 cm side length. Use a rubber hammer to drive the frame through the organic surface layers and a few centimetres into the mineral soil. The frame must enter the soil evenly, do not drive in one side first and then the other. Collect the organic surface material manually, sample the litter layer and every O horizon separately. Be very careful to sample all organic surface layers but no mineral layers.\n\n\n8.5.3 Conventional sampling of mineral layers\nUse a scraper to sample every layer separately and along its entire height and width. Start with the lowest layer. Make sure that you only sample one layer at a time, avoid that material from one layer falls into the other.\n\n\n8.5.4 Volumetric sampling of mineral layers\nAt the soil surface, determine an area large enough for the appropriate number of sampling rings (e.g. 3 rings). The area must be adjacent to the profile wall and close to the measuring tape. In this area, remove the organic surface layers and start sampling layer by layer from top to down. The thickness of a mineral layer may be larger or smaller than the height of a sampling ring or it may be equal (Figure 8.21).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.21: Volumetric sampling\n\n\n\n\nIf the thickness of the layer is larger, subtract the height of the sampling ring from the layer thickness and divide the difference by 2. This result equals the thickness of soil material that has to be removed starting from the upper layer boundary.\nIf the thickness of the layer is equal, it is very important that the surface is plane.\nIf the thickness of the layer is smaller, you will need the thickness of the layer in relation to the height of the sampling ring for calculating the sampled volume.\n\nFor each layer, form a plane surface. If the soil is dryer than field capacity, moisten the surface slowly with water from a spray bottle. Wait until the soil is moist, avoid a water surplus. Then drive in the sampling rings slowly and completely but avoid compacting soil material. For driving in the sampling rings, use a hammer and a piece of wood. The piece should be made of durable wood and have plane surfaces at the top and the bottom. It should be just large enough to cover one sampling ring. If the ring does not move in without deforming, stop driving it in. Try to find a better position.\nTo take out the rings, penetrate the soil with a spatula just beneath the ring and take it out. If the soil is hard to penetrate, you may use a knife with a serrated blade (bread knife). When necessary, cut roots off. When taking the rings out, make sure that no soil material is lost from inside the rings. Place a cap on the top side and turn the ring upside down. Now make the bottom surface plane and place another cap.\nIf you want to do further physical analyses, transfer the ring to the laboratory. If the layer thickness is smaller than the height of the ring (case c), fill up the volume with a resin. If you just want to determine the soil mass, you may empty the soil material from the ring into the designated bag and reuse the ring.\nTo determine the soil mass of a sample of a certain volume, you may also use coated clods (see Annex 2, Chapter 9.5).\n\n\n\n\nBlum, Winfried E.

Therefore, cementing materials (usually of secondary origin) such as organic matter and calcium carbonate may have to be removed. In some cases, de-ferration also needs to be applied. The amount of cementing material has to be documented. However, depending on the aim of study, it may be fundamentally wrong to remove cementing materials. Thus, all pre-treatments are considered optional. However, for soil characterization purposes, removal of organic matter by H2O2 and of carbonates by HCl is routinely carried out. After this pre-treatment, the sample is shaken with a dispersing agent and sand is separated from clay and silt with a 63-μm sieve. The sand is fractionated by dry sieving; the clay and silt fractions are determined by the pipette method or, alternatively, by the hydrometer method.",

    "text": "9.5 Bulk density\nDensity is defined as mass per unit volume. Soil bulk density is the ratio of the mass of solids to the total or bulk volume and is given at dry state. This total volume includes the volume of both solids and pore space. The volume and therefore the bulk density changes with swelling and shrinking, which is related to the water content. For that reason, the water status of the sample prior to drying must be specified.\nTwo different procedures can be used:\n\nUndisturbed core samples. A metal cylinder of known volume is pressed into the soil. The moist sample mass is recorded. This may be the field-moist state or the state after equilibrating the sample at a specified water tension. The sample is then dried at 105 °C and weighed again. The bulk density is the ratio of dry mass to volume (related to the determined water content and/or the specified water tension).\nCoated clods. Field-occurring clods are coated with plastic lacquer (e.g. Saran dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone) to allow underwater determination. This gives the volume of the clod. The moist sample mass is recorded. This may be the field-moist state or the state after equilibrating the clod at a specified water tension. The sample is then dried at 105 °C and weighed again. The bulk density is the ratio of dry mass to volume (related to the determined water content and/or the specified water tension).\n\nIf the sample contains many coarse fragments, the coarse fragments are sieved out after drying and then their mass and volume are determined separately. With that, the bulk density of the fine earth is calculated. The determination of bulk density is very sensitive to natural variability, particularly caused by non-representativeness of the samples (coarse fragments, cementations, cracks, roots, etc.). Therefore, determinations should always be made at least in triplicate.",

The CEC kg-1 clay is calculated by dividing the CEC kg-1 soil by the clay content. Principally, this is only correct if, before doing that, the CEC kg-1 soil attributed to the organic matter is subtracted. But we do not have a reliable method to detect the contribution of the organic matter to the CEC. Therefore, it is recommended to do the calculation as if all the CEC were provided by clay. If the organic matter content is low, the error is negligible.\n\n\n9.13.2 Saturations at pH 7\nThe base saturation (BS) refers to the exchangeable base cations and is calculated as:\nexchangeable (Ca+Mg+K+Na) x 100 / CEC.\nThe exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) is calculated as:\nexchangeable Na x 100 / CEC.\nThe input data are given in cmolc kg-1 and the results in %.\nIf the data for the base saturation are not available, the pHwater can be used instead.

Introducing WRB 2022 into an existing soil or even land information system asks for different solutions than a newly set-up single-aim database. Even if we consider the most widespread relational database approach, not all of the database management systems provide any logical operation and further possibilities foreseen in the Structured Query Language (SQL), and they differ largely in performance and the use of additional programming.\nThe WRB homepage provides guidance and practice examples for database solutions suited to the fourth edition of WRB.",

    "text": "This annex provides suggestions for colours in maps showing the RSGs. The suggestions follow roughly the colour choices in the atlases edited by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.\nThe guidelines for creating map legends are given in Chapter 2.5. A map unit consists of\n\na dominant soil only\na dominant soil plus a codominant soil and/or one or more associated soils\none, two or three codominant soils with or without one or more associated soils. It is strongly recommended to indicate more than just one soil in the map units, because the restriction to only one soil gives often an insufficient or even misleading image.\n\nIt is recommended to use colour symbols and alphanumeric codes to allow the map reader a correct identification of the mapping unit of each polygon. (For raster datasets, only colours can be used.) The colour represents the dominant soil or, if absent, the major codominant soil, only. The other soils are indicated by adding alphanumeric codes. On the first scale level, nothing else is required. If you add elective qualifiers, use alphanumeric codes. The principal qualifiers added at the second and third scale level are also indicated by alphanumeric codes. These are selected by the soil scientist, who makes the map. In complex mapping units with several soils, codominant and associated soils may be mentioned in the mapping unit explanation, only.\n\n\n\nTable 13.1: Colour symbols for RSG maps\n\n\n\n\n\nRSG\nR\nG\nB\nRGB Hex\n\n\n\n\nAcrisol (AC)\n247\n152\n4\n🔴 #F79804\n\n\nAlisol (AL)\n255\n255\n190\n🔴 #FFFFBE\n\n\nAndosol (AN)\n254\n0\n0\n🔴 #FE0000\n\n\nAnthrosol (AT)\n207\n152\n4\n🔴 #CF9804\n\n\nArenosol (AR)\n245\n212\n161\n🔴 #F5D4A1\n\n\nCalcisol (CL)\n254\n244\n0\n🔴 #FEF400\n\n\nCambisol (CM)\n254\n190\n0\n🔴 #FEBE00\n\n\nChernozem (CH)\n145\n77\n53\n🔴 #914D35\n\n\nCryosol (CR)\n75\n61\n172\n🔴 #4B3DAC\n\n\nDurisol (DU)\n239\n228\n190\n🔴 #EFE4BE\n\n\nFerralsol (FR)\n255\n135\n33\n🔴 #FF8721\n\n\nFluvisol (FL)\n0\n254\n253\n🔴 #00FEFD\n\n\nGleysol (GL)\n128\n131\n217\n🔴 #8083D9\n\n\nGypsisol (GY)\n254\n246\n164\n🔴 #FEF6A4\n\n\nHistosol (HS)\n112\n107\n102\n🔴 #706B66\n\n\nKastanozem (KS)\n202\n147\n127\n🔴 #CA937F\n\n\nLeptosol (LP)\n209\n209\n209\n🔴 #D1D1D1\n\n\nLixisol (LX)\n255\n190\n190\n🔴 #FFBEBE\n\n\nLuvisol (LV)\n250\n132\n132\n🔴 #FA8484\n\n\nNitisol (NT)\n255\n167\n127\n🔴 #FFA77F\n\n\nPhaeozem (PH)\n189\n100\n70\n🔴 #BD6446\n\n\nPlanosol (PL)\n247\n125\n58\n🔴 #F77D3A\n\n\nPlinthosol (PT)\n115\n0\n0\n🔴 #730000\n\n\nPodzol (PZ)\n12\n217\n0\n🔴 #0CD900\n\n\nRegosol (RG)\n254\n227\n164\n🔴 #FEE3A4\n\n\nRetisol (RT)\n254\n194\n194\n🔴 #FEC2C2\n\n\nSolonchak (SC)\n254\n0\n250\n🔴 #FE00FA\n\n\nSolonetz (SN)\n249\n194\n254\n🔴 #F9C2FE\n\n\nStagnosol (ST)\n64\n192\n233\n🔴 #40C0E9\n\n\nTechnosol (TC)\n145\n0\n157\n🔴 #91009D\n\n\nUmbrisol (UM)\n115\n142\n127\n🔴 #738E7F\n\n\nVertisol (VR)\n197\n0\n255\n🔴 #C500FF",
