\chapter{Foreword}\label{foreword}}

The soil is a living, heterogeneous and dynamic system that includes
physical, chemical, biological components, and their interactions.
Therefore, to assess its quality it is necessary to measure, describe,
and classify its properties.

Soil classification is necessary to predict its behavior and identify
limitations that allow us to make correct management decisions in the
agricultural, livestock, forestry, urban, environmental, and health
fields to name a few of the most important. IUSS soil scientists
understood all that and the consequent urgent necessity to create an
international soil classification system for name soils and create soil
map legends based on a global reference system.

That is why the International Union of Soil Sciences in 1980 formed a
Working Group to develop the International Reference Base for Soil
Classification (IRB), in 1992 renamed the World Reference Base for Soil
Resources (WRB), with the proposal of setting forth a soil
classification system.

During the 16th World Congress of Soil Science in Montpellier, France,
in 1998, the WRB classification was approved and adopted as the
international soil correlation and communication system of the
International Union of Soil Sciences (IUSS), and the first edition of
the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) was presented.

In 2022, within the framework of the IUSS ``International Decade of
Soils 2015-2024'' and with the firm commitment to offer to the
international community a soil classification system to facilitate both
the implementation of soil inventories and the interpretation of soil
maps as practical tools for decision-making for geologists, agronomists,
farmers, engineers, politicians, etc., the International Union of Soil
Sciences presents the fourth edition of the World Reference Base (WRB).

The IUSS appreciates the efforts of all those who participate in the WRB
working group and make the presentation of this new edition possible as
an IUSS edition free to download from the IUSS website.

\chapter{Preface}\label{preface}}

The first edition of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB)
was published in 1998, the second in 2006 and the third in 2014. In
2022, at the 22nd World Congress of Soil Science in Glasgow, we present
the fourth edition.

The fourth edition is the result of another eight years of testing.
During international field workshops, we classified numerous soil
profiles and developed ideas for improvement. Establishing algorithms
for automated classification helped overcome inconsistencies. The 32
Reference Soil Groups were maintained but soil characteristics, not
reflected or properly defined up till now in the WRB, had to be taken
into account. Many criteria in the diagnostics, the key and in the
definitions of the qualifiers were sharpened and refined. Special effort
was made to ensure consistency; that the same features are worded in the
same way throughout the text, including the annexes.

The fourth edition has new annexes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A new Field Guide, exactly tailored to the needs of WRB, with many
  definitions of field characteristics, supported by numerous
  illustrations - it may be used instead of the FAO Guidelines for Soil
  Description (2006)
\item
  Horizon and Layer Designations with master symbols and suffixes
\item
  Recommendations for Colour Symbols for Reference Soil Group Maps
\item
  A Soil Description Sheet and a Guidance on Database Set-Up to be
  provided as separate documents for download.
\end{itemize}

A large number of soil scientists contributed to the fourth edition (see
Acknowledgements). We all hope that the new edition promotes a better
understanding of soils, of their distribution and properties, and of
their protection and sustainable management.

The first three editions of the WRB were published by the FAO in the
World Soil Resources Reports series. This was no longer possible. We are
glad that the present fourth edition is published by the IUSS. This
reflects well the character of the WRB as a publication of an IUSS
Working Group.

\subsection{From its beginnings to the third edition
2014/15}\label{from-its-beginnings-to-the-third-edition-201415}}

The World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) is based on the Legend
(FAO-Unesco, 1974) and the Revised Legend (FAO, 1988) of the Soil Map of
the World (FAO-Unesco, 1971-1981). In 1980, the International Society of
Soil Science (ISSS, since 2002 the International Union of Soil Sciences,
IUSS) formed a Working Group `International Reference Base for Soil
Classification' for further elaboration of a science-based international
soil classification system. This Working Group was renamed `World
Reference Base for Soil Resources' in 1992. The Working Group presented
the first edition of the WRB in 1998 (FAO, 1998), the second edition in
2006 (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) and the third edition in 2014/15
(IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015). In 1998, the ISSS Council endorsed the
WRB as its officially recommended terminology to name and classify
soils.

A detailed description of the older WRB history is given in the second
edition (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) and the third edition of the WRB
(IUSS Working Group WRB, 2015).

edition
2022}\label{from-the-third-edition-2014-update-2015-to-the-fourth-edition-2022}}

The third edition of the WRB was presented at the 20th World Congress of
Soil Science 2014 in Jeju, Korea. In 2015, an Update was published
online, which is the valid WRB from 2015 to 2022:
https://www.fao.org/3/i3794en/I3794en.pdf.

The second edition was translated into several languages: Czech, French,
Georgian, Polish, Russian, Slovene, and Spanish.

Since 2014, several WRB field workshops were organized to test the third
edition:

2014: Ireland\\
2017: Latvia and Estonia\\
2018: Romania\\
2019: Mongolia\\
2022: Iceland

The field tours associated with the meetings of the IUSS Commission on
Soil Classification in South Africa (2016) and Mexico (2022) were
additional tests of the third edition and also the tours offered with
the 21st World Congress of Soil Science 2018 in Brazil.

Now, after 8 years, a fourth edition has been prepared.

\hypertarget{major-changes-in-wrb-2022}{%
\section{Major changes in WRB 2022}\label{major-changes-in-wrb-2022}}

The major changes are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The contents of the book were rearranged:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The former Annex~1 (Descriptions) was deleted. The descriptions were
    not fully up to date.
  \item
    Annex~2 (Laboratory methods) was maintained.
  \item
    The former Annex~3 (Codes) is now Chapter~6. This reflects that the
    codes, if used, are not only recommended but mandatory.
  \item
    The former Annex~4 is integrated in the new Annex~1.
  \item
    The new Annex~1 is a Field Guide. It replaces the FAO Guidelines
    (2006). Compared to the FAO Guidelines, the Annex~1 is more
    comprehensive for WRB, more precise and more didactical using many
    illustrations. It gives many definitions of field characteristics
    that up till now have been nowhere defined in WRB, neither in the
    WRB itself, nor in the FAO Guidelines. Many of these definitions
    were taken from the USDA Soil Survey Manual (2017) and the NRCS
    Fieldbook (2012), which brings WRB and Soil Taxonomy closer
    together.
  \item
    The new Annex~3 provides brief definitions of layer symbols further
    developing the definitions of the FAO Guidelines.
  \item
    The new Annex~4 explains a soil description sheet that is provided
    online.
  \item
    The new Annex~5 gives a guidance on database set-up. The details are
    provided online.
  \item
    The new Annex~6 gives recommendations for colour symbols for
    Reference Soil Group maps.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  In Chapter~2.1, General rules and definitions, several definitions
  have been added for WRB: fine earth, whole soil, litter layer, soil
  surface, mineral soil surface, soil layer, soil horizon. Some new
  general rules have been added to make the definitions easier.
\item
  All Reference Soil Groups (RSGs) are maintained. There are some
  changes in the Key: Planosols and Stagnosols are now before Nitisols
  and Ferralsols. Fluvisols are before Arenosols.
\item
  The following diagnostics were deleted:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    fulvic horizon, melanic horizon: belonged to an outdated concept of
    soil organic matter;
  \item
    aridic properties: had a non-systematic combination of various
    characteristics (the wind deposition is now characterized by the
    aeolic material, see below);
  \item
    geric properties: can be better expressed as qualifier;
  \item
    sulfidic material: not needed after introducing the hypersulfidic
    and the hyposulfidic material in 2014.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The following diagnostics were introduced:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    albic horizon: In the first and the second edition of WRB, the albic
    horizon was defined. However, it was only defined by colour, and
    results of soil-forming processes were not required. Therefore, it
    was changed to albic material in 2014. But this made the definition
    of the Albic qualifier difficult. Now, the albic horizon was
    reintroduced, explicitly requiring results of soil-forming
    processes. The albic material was maintained (just defined by
    colour) and renamed claric material (see below)
  \item
    cohesic horizon: Dense subsurface horizon dominated by kaolinite. It
    is found in tropical regions with seasonal climate and was not
    considered so far in WRB.
  \item
    limonic horizon: Accumulation of Fe by capillary rise in groundwater
    soils. The accumulation is so strong that Fe oxides cause a
    cementation. It is traditionally referred to as bog iron.
  \item
    panpaic horizon: Buried A horizon.
  \item
    tsitelic horizon: Accumulation of Fe by subsurface flow, usually
    from Planosols and Stagnosols further up in the landscape.
  \item
    protogypsic properties: Accumulation of secondary gypsum, not
    sufficient for a gypsic or petrogypsic horizon.
  \item
    aeolic material: Deposited by wind.
  \item
    mulmic material: Mineral material with a high content of soil
    organic carbon, derived from organic material. Drainage of organic
    material causes accelerated decomposition, and eventually the
    content of soil organic carbon sinks below 20\%, which transforms
    the organic material into mineral material.
  \item
    organotechnic material: Contains large amounts of organic artefacts
    and relatively small contents of soil organic carbon in the fine
    earth.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The following diagnostic materials received new names:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    claric material instead of albic material: After reintroducing the
    albic horizon, it had to be avoided that a diagnostic material and a
    diagnostic horizon have the same name. The albic material was
    therefore renamed in claric material.
  \item
    solimovic material instead of colluvic material: The word colluvium
    has very different meanings in different countries. To avoid
    confusion, the new name solimovic material was coined. It explains
    that at least parts of the accumulated material underwent soil
    formation before having been transported.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Many criteria in the diagnostics, the key and in the definitions of
  the qualifiers were sharpened and refined. Special effort was
  undertaken to make sure that the same features are worded in the same
  way throughout the text, including the annexes.
\item
  Some new qualifiers were defined, some existing ones were deleted, and
  many definitions have been refined.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-object-classified-in-the-wrb}{%
\section{The object classified in the
WRB}\label{the-object-classified-in-the-wrb}}

Like many common words, `soil' has several meanings. In its traditional
meaning, soil is the natural medium for the growth of plants, whether or
not it has discernible soil horizons (Soil Survey Staff, 1999).

In the 1998 WRB, soil was defined as:

\begin{quote}
``\ldots{} a continuous natural body which has three spatial and one
temporal dimension. The three main features governing soil are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  It is formed by \textbf{mineral and organic constituents} and includes
  solid, liquid and gaseous phases.
\item
  The constituents are organized in \textbf{structures}, specific for
  the pedological medium. These structures form the morphological aspect
  of the soil cover, equivalent to the anatomy of a living being. They
  result from the history of the soil cover and from its actual dynamics
  and properties. Study of the structures of the soil cover facilitates
  perception of the physical, chemical and biological properties; it
  permits understanding the past and present of the soil and predicting
  its future.
\item
  The soil is in \textbf{constant evolution}, thus giving the soil its
  fourth dimension, time.''
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

Although there are good arguments to limit soil survey and mapping to
identifiable stable soil areas with a certain thickness, the WRB has
taken the more comprehensive approach to name any object forming part of
the \textbf{\emph{epiderm of the earth}} (Sokolov, 1997; Nachtergaele,
2005). This approach has a number of advantages; notably that it allows
for addressing environmental problems in a systematic and holistic way
and avoids sterile discussion on a universally agreed definition of soil
and its required thickness and stability. Therefore, the object
classified in the WRB is: \emph{any material within 2~m of the Earth's
surface that is in contact with the atmosphere, excluding living
organisms, areas with continuous ice not covered by other material, and
water bodies deeper than 2~m}. If explicitly stated, the object
classified in the WRB includes layers deeper than 2~m. In tidal areas,
the depth of 2~m is to be applied at mean low water springs.

The definition includes \emph{continuous rock}, paved urban soils, soils
of industrial areas, soils on buildings and other (permanent/stable)
constructions, cave soils as well as subaqueous soils. Soils under
\emph{continuous rock}, except those that occur in caves, are generally
not considered for classification, but in special cases, the WRB may be
even used to classify soils under rock, for example for
palaeopedological reconstruction of the environment. The use of WRB for
paleosols is still in an experimental stage.

\hypertarget{basic-principles}{%
\section{Basic principles}\label{basic-principles}}

\hypertarget{general-principles}{%
\subsection{General principles}\label{general-principles}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The classification of soils is based on soil properties defined in
  terms of diagnostic horizons, diagnostic properties and diagnostic
  materials (together called the \textbf{diagnostics}), which to the
  greatest extent possible should be measurable and observable in the
  field. Table~1.1 provides an overview of the diagnostics used in the
  WRB.
\item
  The selection of diagnostic characteristics takes into account their
  relationship with soil-forming processes. An understanding of
  soil-forming processes contributes to a better characterization of
  soils but these processes should not, as such, be used as
  differentiating criteria.
\item
  To the extent possible at a high level of generalization, diagnostic
  features that are of significance for soil management are selected.
\item
  Climate parameters are not applied in the classification of soils. It
  is understood that they should be used for interpretation purposes, in
  combination with soil properties, but they should not form part of
  soil definitions. The classification of soils is therefore not
  subordinated to the availability of climate data. The name of a
  certain soil will not become obsolete due to global or local climate
  change.
\item
  The WRB is a comprehensive classification system that enables
  accommodation of national soil classification systems.
\item
  The WRB is not intended to be a substitute for national soil
  classification systems, but rather to serve as a common denominator
  for communication at the international level.
\item
  The WRB comprises two levels of categorical detail:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    the \textbf{\emph{First Level}} having 32 Reference Soil Groups
    (RSGs);
  \item
    the \textbf{\emph{Second Level}}, consisting of the name of the RSG
    combined with a set of principal and supplementary qualifiers.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Many RSGs in the WRB are representative of major soil regions so as to
  provide a comprehensive overview of the world's soil cover.
\item
  Definitions and descriptions reflect variations in soil
  characteristics that occur both vertically and laterally in the
  landscape.
\item
  The term \emph{Reference Base} is connotative of the common
  denominator function of the WRB: its units (RSGs) have sufficient
  width to facilitate harmonization and correlation with national
  systems.
\item
  In addition to serving as a correlation between existing
  classification systems, the WRB also serves as a communication tool
  for compiling global soil databases and for the inventory and
  monitoring of the world's soil resources.

  The nomenclature used to distinguish soil groups retains terms that

\hypertarget{structure}{%
\subsection{Structure}\label{structure}}

Each RSG of the WRB is provided with a listing of possible principal and
supplementary qualifiers, from which the user can construct the second
level of the classification. The principal qualifiers are given in a
priority sequence. The broad principles that govern the WRB class
differentiation are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  At the \textbf{\emph{First Level}} (RSGs), classes are differentiated
  mainly according to characteristic soil features produced by primary
  pedogenic process, except where special soil parent materials are of
  overriding importance.
\item
  At the \textbf{\emph{Second Level}} (RSGs with qualifiers), soils are
  differentiated according to soil features resulting from any secondary
  soil-forming process that has significantly affected the primary
  characteristics. In many cases, soil characteristics that have a
  significant effect on land use are taken into account.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{evolution-of-the-system}{%
\subsection{Evolution of the system}\label{evolution-of-the-system}}

The Revised Legend of the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World (FAO, 1988)
was used as a basis for the development of the WRB in order to take
advantage of the international soil correlation that had already been
conducted through this project and elsewhere. The first edition of the
WRB, published in 1998, comprised 30 RSGs; the following editions have
32 RSGs.

\hypertarget{architecture}{%
\section{Architecture}\label{architecture}}

The WRB comprises two levels of categorical detail:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  the \textbf{\emph{First Level}} having 32 Reference Soil Groups
  (RSGs);
\item
  the \textbf{\emph{Second Level}}, consisting of the name of the RSG
  combined with a set of principal and supplementary qualifiers.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{first-level-the-reference-soil-groups}{%
\subsection{First Level: The Reference Soil
Groups}\label{first-level-the-reference-soil-groups}}

Table~1.2 provides an overview of the RSGs and the rationale for the
sequence of the RSGs in the WRB Key. The RSGs are allocated to groups on
the basis of dominant identifiers, i.e.~the soil-forming factors or
processes that most clearly condition the soil.

\hypertarget{second-level-the-reference-soil-groups-with-their-qualifiers}{%
\subsection{Second Level: The Reference Soil Groups with their
qualifiers}\label{second-level-the-reference-soil-groups-with-their-qualifiers}}

In the WRB, a distinction is made between \textbf{principal qualifiers}
and \textbf{supplementary qualifiers}. Principal qualifiers are regarded
as being most significant for a further characterization of soils of the
particular RSG. They are given in a ranked order. Supplementary
qualifiers give some further details about the soil. They are not ranked
but listed alphabetically (exception: the supplementary qualifiers
related to the texture are given first). Chapter 2 gives the rules for
the use of qualifiers for naming soils and for creating map legends.
Constructing the second level by adding qualifiers to the RSG has
several advantages compared with a dichotomic key:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For every soil, the RSG has the appropriate number of associated
  qualifiers. Soils with few characteristics have short names; soils
  with many characteristics (e.g.~polygenetic soils) have longer names.
\item
  The WRB is capable of indicating most of the soil's properties, which
  are incorporated into an informative soil name.
\item
  The system is robust. Missing data do not necessarily lead to a
  dramatic error in the classification of a soil. If one qualifier is
  erroneously added or erroneously omitted based on incomplete data, the
  rest of the soil name remains correct.
\end{itemize}

Topsoil characteristics are prone to rapid change with time and are

topsoil classification systems have been made (Broll et al., 2006; Fox

\hypertarget{general-rules-and-definitions}{%
\section{General rules and
definitions}\label{general-rules-and-definitions}}

The following principles have to be considered for classification in
WRB:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  All data refer to the fine earth, unless stated otherwise. The
  \textbf{fine earth} comprises the soil constituents ≤~2~mm. The
  \textbf{whole soil} comprises fine earth, coarse fragments, artefacts
  and dead plant remnants of any size. These rules also apply to
  cemented layers.
\item
  All data are given \textbf{by mass} (dried at 105°~C, see Annex~2,
  Chapter~9.2), unless stated otherwise.
\item
  A \textbf{litter layer} is a loose layer that contains
  \textgreater~90\% (by volume, related to the fine earth plus all dead
  plant remnants) recognizable dead plant tissues (e.g.~undecomposed
  leaves). Dead plant material still connected to living plants
  (e.g.~dead parts of \emph{Sphagnum} mosses) is not regarded to form
  part of a litter layer. The \textbf{soil surface} (0~cm) is by
  convention the surface of the soil after removing, if present, the
  litter layer and, if present, below a layer of living plants
  (e.g.~living mosses). The \textbf{mineral soil surface} is the upper
  limit of the uppermost mineral horizon (see Annex~1, Chapters~8.3.1
  and 8.3.2).
\item
  A \textbf{soil layer} is a zone in the soil, approximately parallel to
  the soil surface, with properties different from layers above and/or
  below it. If at least one of these properties is the result of
  soil-forming processes, the layer is called a \textbf{soil horizon}.
  In the diagnostic criteria, the term `horizon' is mainly used for the
  defined diagnostic horizons. The other layers are mainly called
  `layer' to make sure that the criteria apply, even if they were not
  regarded to be soil horizons.
\item
  If a criterion is worded as a conditional clause (if\ldots) and the
  condition (\textbf{if-clause}) is not true, the criterion is ignored.
\item
  Numerical values obtained in the field or in the laboratory have to be
  taken as such and \textbf{must not be rounded} when compared with the
  threshold values in the diagnostic criteria.
\item
  The diagnostic criteria must be fulfilled \textbf{throughout the
  specified depth range}, unless stated otherwise. If a diagnostic
  horizon consists of several subhorizons, the diagnostic criteria
  (except thickness) must be fulfilled in every subhorizon separately
  (averages are not calculated), unless stated otherwise.
\item
  The term \textbf{limiting layer} used in definitions comprises
  \emph{continuous rock}, \emph{technic hard material},
  \emph{petrocalcic}, \emph{petroduric}, \emph{petrogypsic} and
  \emph{petroplinthic} horizons and other cemented layers with both of
  the following: cementation with a class of at least moderately
  cemented and a continuity to the extent that vertical fractures, if
  present, have an average horizontal spacing of ≥~10~cm and occupy
  \textless~20\% (by volume, related to the whole soil).
\item
  On a \textbf{slope}, the soil is described as a vertical profile. The
  thickness and depth values are calculated by multiplying the
  vertically measured values by the cosine of the inclination angle (see
  Annex~1, Chapter~8.1.2) (Prietzel \& Wiesmeier, 2019). This is
  especially important on steep slopes.
\end{enumerate}

Classification consists of three steps:

\hypertarget{step-one-detecting-diagnostic-horizons-properties-and-materials-for-short-diagnostics}{%
\subsection{Step one -- detecting diagnostic horizons, properties and
materials (for short:
diagnostics)}\label{step-one-detecting-diagnostic-horizons-properties-and-materials-for-short-diagnostics}}

Describe the soil applying the Field Guide in Annex~1 (Chapter~8). It is
useful that you already in the field compile a list of the possible
diagnostic horizons, properties and materials observed (see Chapter~3).
Conduct the relevant analyses according to Annex~2 (Chapter~9). Then,
decide on the presence of diagnostics. \textbf{For the decision, only
the diagnostic criteria are relevant} - neither the name of the
diagnostic, nor any other description. A layer may fulfil the criteria
of more than one diagnostic horizon, property or material, which are
then regarded as overlapping or coinciding.

\subsection{Step two -- allocating the soil to a Reference Soil

characteristics are compared to the WRB Key (Chapter~4) in order to
allocate the soil to the appropriate \textbf{Reference Soil
Group~(RSG)}. The user must go through the Key systematically, starting
at the beginning and excluding one by one all RSGs for which the
specified requirements are not met. The soil belongs to the first RSG
for which it fulfils the criteria.

\hypertarget{step-three-allocating-the-qualifiers}{%
\subsection{Step three -- allocating the
qualifiers}\label{step-three-allocating-the-qualifiers}}

For the second level of the WRB classification, qualifiers are used. The
qualifiers available for use with a particular RSG are listed in the
Key, along with the RSG. They are divided into principal and
supplementary qualifiers.

The \textbf{principal qualifiers} are ranked and given in an order of
importance. The rank of the principal qualifiers reflects particular
soil chacracteristics or properties strongly influencing the soil's
functionality:

Examples of subdivisions based on soil characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Vitric, Aluandic and Silandic for Andosols
\item
  Carbic and Rustic for Podzols
\item
  anthropogenic horizons: Anthraquic, Hortic, Hydragric, Irragric,
  Plaggic, Pretic, Terric. These soils have distinct physico-chemical
  characteristics reflecting their formation.
\end{itemize}

Examples of subdivisions reflecting major functional restrictions (many
of them indicate a deviation from the central image of the RSG):
Abruptic, Fragic, Gleyic, Leptic, Petrocalcic, Petroduric, Petrogypsic,
Petroplinthic, Retic, Skeletic, Stagnic, Thionic.

The \textbf{supplementary qualifiers} are not ranked.
\textbf{Supplementary qualifiers related to the texture}, if applicable,
are the first in the list. If several ones apply (see Chapter~2.3), they
are placed in the sequence from the top to the bottom of the soil
profile (e.g.~Episiltic, Katoloamic). All \textbf{other supplementary
qualifiers} follow them and are used in alphabetical order.

Qualifiers may be principal for some RSGs and supplementary for others,
e.g., Turbic is principal for Cryosols and supplementary for other RSGs.

The principal qualifiers are added before the name of the RSG without
brackets and without commas. The sequence is from right to left,
i.e.~the uppermost qualifier in the list is placed closest to the name
of the RSG. The supplementary qualifiers are added in brackets after the
name of the RSG and are separated from each other by commas. The
sequence is from left to right, i.e.~the first qualifier in the list is
placed closest to the name of the RSG.

If two or more qualifiers in the list are \textbf{separated by a slash}
(\textbf{/}), they are either mutually exclusive (e.g.~Dystric and
Eutric) or one of them is redundant (see below) with the redundant
qualifier(s) listed after the slash(es). In the soil name, supplementary
qualifiers are placed in the order of the alphabet (exception:
supplementary qualifiers related to the texture, see above), even if
their position in the list differs from the alphabetical sequence due to
the use of the slash.

Qualifiers that are mutually exclusive may apply to the same soil at
different depths. In this case, they can be used both, each one with the
respective specifier (see Chapter~2.3). If no specifier is used, only
the first applicable qualifier can be used.

\textbf{Qualifiers conveying redundant information are not added}. This
is a general rule and applies even if the slash is not used. For
example, Eutric is not added if the Calcaric qualifier applies.

\textbf{If qualifiers apply but are not in the list for the particular
RSG}, they should be added last as supplementary qualifiers.

The names of the RSGs and the (sub)qualifiers must start with a capital
letter.

\hypertarget{rules-for-naming-soils}{%
\section{Rules for naming soils}\label{rules-for-naming-soils}}

For naming a soil at the second level, all the principal and
supplementary qualifiers that apply must be added to the name of the
RSG.

\hypertarget{example-of-naming-a-soil-according-to-wrb}{%
\subsection{Example of naming a soil according to
WRB}\label{example-of-naming-a-soil-according-to-wrb}}

\hypertarget{field-description}{%
\subsubsection{Field description}\label{field-description}}

A soil developed from loess with high-activity clays has a marked clay
increase at 60~cm depth, clay coatings in the clay-rich horizon, no
stratification, and a field pH value around 6 in the depth from 50~to
100~cm. The clay-poor upper soil is subdivided into a darker upper and a
light-coloured lower horizon. The clay-rich horizon has a limited amount
of oximorphic features with intensive colours inside the soil aggregates
and reducing conditions in some parts during springtime. The following
conclusions can be drawn (for subqualifiers see Chapter~2.3):

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 4\tabcolsep) * \real{0.2535}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 4\tabcolsep) * \real{0.4930}}
  >{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{(\columnwidth - 4\tabcolsep) * \real{0.2535}}@{}}
\toprule()
\endhead
a. & clay increase without \emph{lithic discontinuity} and/or with clay
coatings & --\textgreater{} \emph{argic horizon} \\
b. & \emph{argic horizon} with high CEC and more base cations than Al
(inferred by pH~6) & --\textgreater{} Luvisol \\
c. & light colour in the eluvial horizon & --\textgreater{} Albic
qualifier \\
d. & some oximorphic features inside aggregates & --\textgreater{}
\emph{stagnic properties} \\
e. & \emph{stagnic properties} and \emph{reducing conditions} starting
at 60~cm & --\textgreater{} Endostagnic qualifier \\
f. & clay coatings & --\textgreater{} Cutanic qualifier \\
g. & clay increase without \emph{lithic discontinuity} &
--\textgreater{} Differentic qualifier \\
\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

The \textbf{field classification} is Albic Endostagnic Luvisol (Cutanic,
Differentic).

\hypertarget{laboratory-analyses}{%
\subsubsection{Laboratory analyses}\label{laboratory-analyses}}

The laboratory analyses confirm a high CEC~kg\textsuperscript{-1} clay
in the \emph{argic horizon} and a high base saturation in the depth from
50~-~100~cm. They further detect the texture class of silty clay loam
with 30\% clay (Siltic qualifier) from 0 -~60 cm (Ano- specifier) and of
silty clay with 45\% clay (Clayic qualifier) from 60~-~100 cm (Endo-
specifier). The organic carbon content in the topsoil is intermediate
(Ochric qualifier).

The \textbf{final classification} is Albic Endostagnic Luvisol
(Anosiltic, Endoclayic, Cutanic, Differentic, Ochric).

\hypertarget{subqualifiers}{%
\section{Subqualifiers}\label{subqualifiers}}

\textbf{Qualifiers may be combined with specifiers} (e.g.~Epi-, Proto-)
\textbf{to form subqualifiers} (e.g.~Epiarenic, Protocalcic). Depending
on the specifier, the subqualifier fulfils all the criteria of the
respective qualifier, or it deviates in a defined way from its set of
criteria. The following rules apply:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If a subqualifier applies that fulfils all the criteria of the
  qualifier, the subqualifier can - but does not have to - be used
  instead of its qualifier (\textbf{optional subqualifiers}).
\item
  If a subqualifier applies that fulfils all the criteria of the
  qualifier except thickness and/or depth criteria, the subqualifier can
  - but does not have to - be used, but not the qualifier (additional
  subqualifiers). Note: It may happen that the qualifier is not listed
  with the available qualifiers for the respective RSG in Chapter 4.
\item
  If a subqualifier applies that deviates in a defined way from the set
  of criteria of the qualifier, the subqualifier must be used instead of
  the qualifier that is listed as available for the respective RSG in
  Chapter 4 (mandatory subqualifiers). This is the case for some
  subqualifiers with a given definition (see below).
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Optional and additional subqualifiers are recommended especially
for naming soils}. Their use is not recommended for principal qualifiers
in map units or wherever generalization is important.

The use of specifiers does not change the \textbf{position of the
qualifier in the soil name} with the exception of the specifiers Bathy-,
Thapto-, and Proto- (see below). Those supplementary qualifiers that are
added according to the alphabet follow the alphabetical order of the
qualifier, not the subqualifier.

Some subqualifiers can be constructed by the user according to certain
rules (see Chapter~2.3.1). Other subqualifiers have a fixed definition
given in Chapter~5 (see Chapter~2.3.2).

\hypertarget{subqualifiers-constructed-by-the-users}{%
\subsection{Subqualifiers constructed by the
users}\label{subqualifiers-constructed-by-the-users}}

\hypertarget{constructed-subqualifiers-related-to-depth-requirements}{%
\subsubsection{Constructed subqualifiers related to depth
requirements}\label{constructed-subqualifiers-related-to-depth-requirements}}

Qualifiers that have depth requirements can be combined with the
specifiers \textbf{Epi-}, \textbf{Endo-}, \textbf{Amphi-},
\textbf{Ano-}, \textbf{Kato-}, \textbf{Poly-}, \textbf{Panto-} and
\textbf{Bathy-} to create subqualifiers (e.g.~Epicalcic, Endocalcic)
further expressing the depth of occurrence. Qualifiers that are mutually
exclusive at the same depth may be applicable at different depths in the
same soil. Qualifiers that already have a depth range requirement of
0-50~cm or 50-100~cm of the soil surface do not require these extra
depth specifiers. For every qualifier with depth requirements, the
definition (Chapter~5) specifies whether the depth requirement refers
\textbf{to the soil surface or to the mineral soil surface}.
Subqualifiers related to depth requirements are only used if the
relevant soil characteristics are \textbf{reported until ≥~100~cm of the
(mineral) soil surface or to a limiting layer}, whichever is shallower.

Depending on the particular qualifier and the particular soil
characteristics, depth-related subqualifiers are used in the following
different ways:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If a qualifier refers to a characteristic that occurs at a specific
  point of depth (e.g.~Raptic), \textbf{optional subqualifiers} can be
  constructed with the following specifiers:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Epi-} (from Greek \emph{epi}, over): the characteristic is
    present somewhere ≤~50 cm of the (mineral) soil surface and is
    absent \textgreater~50 and ≤~100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface;
    not used if a limiting layer starts ≤~50~cm from the (mineral) soil
    surface.
  \item
    \textbf{Endo-} (from Greek \emph{endon}, inside): the characteristic
    is present somewhere \textgreater~50 and ≤~100~cm of the (mineral)
    soil surface and is absent ≤~50~cm of the (mineral) soil surface.
  \item
    \textbf{Amphi-} (from Greek \emph{amphi}, around): the
    characteristic is present two or more times, once or more times
    somewhere ≤~50~cm of the (mineral) soil surface and once or more
    times somewhere \textgreater~50 and ≤~100~cm of the (mineral) soil
    surface.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If a qualifier refers to a \textbf{layer} (e.g.~Calcic, Arenic,
  Fluvic), \textbf{optional subqualifiers} can be constructed with the
  following specifiers (see Figure 2.1):

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Epi-} (from Greek \emph{epi}, over): the layer has its lower
    limit ≤~50~cm of the (mineral) soil surface; and no such layer
    occurs between 50 and 100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface; not used
    if the definition of the qualifier or of the horizon requires that
    the layer starts at the (mineral) soil surface; if a limiting layer
    starts ≤~50~cm from the mineral soil surface, the qualifier
    referring to the limiting layer receives the Epi- specifier and all
    other qualifiers remain without specifier.
  \item
    \textbf{Endo-} (from Greek \emph{endon}, inside): the layer starts
    ≥~50~cm from the (mineral) soil surface; and no such layer occurs
    \textless~50~cm of the (mineral) soil surface. (Examples:
    Endocalcic: the \emph{calcic horizon} starts ≥~50 and ≤~100~cm from
    the soil surface; Endospodic: the \emph{spodic horizon} starts ≥~50
    and ≤ 200 cm from the mineral soil surface.)
  \item
    \textbf{Amphi-} (from Greek \emph{amphi}, around): the layer starts
    \textgreater~0 and \textless~50~cm from the (mineral) soil surface
    and has its lower limit \textgreater~50 and \textless~100~cm of the
    (mineral) soil surface; and no such layer occurs \textless~1~cm of
    the (mineral) soil surface; and no such layer occurs between 99 and
    100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface or directly above a limiting
    layer.
  \item
    \textbf{Ano-} (from Greek \emph{ano}, upwards): the layer starts at
    the (mineral) soil surface and has its lower limit \textgreater~50
    and \textless~100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface; and no such
    layer occurs between 99 and 100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface or
    directly above a limiting layer.
  \item
    \textbf{Kato-} (from Greek \emph{kato}, downwards): the layer starts
    \textgreater~0 and \textless~50~cm from the (mineral) soil surface
    and has its lower limit ≥~100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface or at
    a limiting layer starting \textgreater~50~cm from the (mineral) soil
    surface; and no such layer occurs \textless~1~cm of the (mineral)
    soil surface.
  \item
    \textbf{Poly-} (from Greek \emph{polys}, many):

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      diagnostic horizons: two or more diagnostic horizons are present
      at the depth required by the qualifier definition, interrupted by
      layers that do not fulfil the criteria of the respective
      diagnostic horizon;
    \item
      other layers: two or more layers within 100~cm of the (mineral)
      soil surface fulfil the criteria of the qualifier, interrupted by
      layers that do not fulfil the criteria of the respective
      qualifier; and the thickness criterion is fulfilled by the sum of
      the thicknesses of the layers; it may or may not be fulfilled by
      the single layers.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \textbf{Panto-} (from Greek \emph{pan}, all): the layer starts at
    the (mineral) soil surface and has its lower limit ≥~100~cm of the
    (mineral) soil surface or at a limiting layer starting
    \textgreater~50~cm from the (mineral) soil surface.
  \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Qualifiers that are mutually exclusive may occur in the same
soil at different depths}. In this case, they can be used both, each one
with the respective specifier. If the specifiers are used with principal
qualifiers, the qualifier referring to the upper layer is placed closer
to the name of the RSG. If the specifiers are used with supplementary
qualifiers related to the texture, the qualifiers are placed in the
sequence from the top to the bottom of the profile. The sequence of the
other supplementary qualifiers is according to the alphabetical position
of the qualifier, not the subqualifier.

\caption{Specifiers to construct optional subqualifiers related to depth
requirements and referring to a particular layer (Bathy- not
illustrated), modified by S. Dondeyne}

\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If a qualifier refers to the \textbf{major part of a certain depth
  range or to half or more of a certain depth range} (Dystric and
  Eutric, only), \textbf{additional subqualifiers} can be constructed
  with the following specifiers:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Epi-} (from Greek \emph{epi}, over): the characteristic is
    present in the major part (or half or more of the part) between the
    specified upper limit and 50~cm of the (mineral) soil surface and is
    absent in the major part (or half or more of the part) between the
    specified upper limit and 100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface or
    between the specified upper limit and a limiting layer starting
    \textgreater~50~cm from the mineral soil surface, whichever is
    shallower.
  \item
    \textbf{Endo-} (from Greek \emph{endon}, inside): the characteristic
    is present in the major part (or half or more of the part) between
    50 and 100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface or between 50~cm of the
    (mineral) soil surface and a limiting layer, whichever is shallower,
    and is absent in the major part (or half or more of the part)
    between the specified upper limit and 100~cm of the (mineral) soil
    surface or between the specified upper limit and a limiting layer,
    whichever is shallower.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{These additional subqualifiers are only allowed together with
the predominant qualifier}. If it is a principal qualifier, the
predominant qualifier stands closer to the name of the RSG (Epidystic
Eutric, Endodystric Eutric, Epieutric Dystric, Endoeutric Dystric). If
it is a supplementary qualifier, the alphabetical sequence of the
qualifiers is followed.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\setcounter{enumi}{3}
\tightlist
\item
  If a qualifier refers to a \textbf{specified depth range throughout}
  (Relocatic, only), \textbf{additional subqualifiers} can be
  constructed with the following specifiers:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Epi-} (from Greek \emph{epi}, over): the characteristic is
    present throughout between the (mineral) soil surface and 50~cm of
    the (mineral) soil surface and is absent in some layer between 50
    and 100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface.
  \item
    \textbf{Endo-} (not applicable).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If a qualifier refers to a \textbf{percentage} (e.g.~Skeletic),
  \textbf{additional subqualifiers} can be constructed with the
  following specifiers (no subqualifier if a limiting layer starts
  \textless~60~cm from the mineral soil surface):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Epi-} (from Greek \emph{epi}, over): the characteristic is
    present between the (mineral) soil surface and 50~cm of the
    (mineral) soil surface but is not present throughout, i.e., if
    averaged over a depth of 100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface or
    between the (mineral) soil surface and a limiting layer, whichever
    is shallower.
  \item
    \textbf{Endo-} (from Greek \emph{endon}, inside): the characteristic
    is present between 50 and 100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface or
    between 50~cm of the (mineral) soil surface and a limiting layer,
    whichever is shallower, but is not present throughout, i.e., if
    averaged over a depth of 100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface or
    between the (mineral) soil surface and a limiting layer, whichever
    is shallower.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  If a qualifier refers to a specific point of depth or to a layer, but
  its criteria are only fulfilled if layers at a depth of
  \textgreater~100~cm of the (mineral) soil surface are taken into
  account, the \textbf{Bathy-} (from Greek \emph{bathys}, deep)
  specifier can be used to construct \textbf{additional subqualifiers}.
  The Bathy- subqualifier extends to a greater depth than specified for
  the qualifier. If the Endo- specifier cannot be added to a qualifier,
  the Bathy- specifier cannot be used either (e.g.~Alcalic: neither
  Endo-, nor Bathy-). If used with a principal qualifier, the Bathy-
  subqualifier \textbf{must shift to the supplementary qualifiers} and
  be placed within the list of the supplementary qualifiers according to
  the alphabetical position of the qualifier, not the subqualifier. With
  the Bathy- specifier, qualifiers that are not even in the list for the
  particular RSG (see Chapter~4) can be added, for example Eutric
  Arenosol (Bathylixic). If it comprises buried layers, Bathy- is only
  allowed in combination with the Thapto- specifier,
  e.g.~Thaptobathyvertic (see the Thapto- specifier, below, and
  Chapter~2.4).
\end{enumerate}

Note: Specifiers conveying redundant information are not added. For
example: Skeletic Epileptic Cambisol, not: Episkeletic Epileptic
Cambisol.

\hypertarget{constructed-subqualifiers-related-to-other-requirements}{%
\subsubsection{Constructed subqualifiers related to other
requirements}\label{constructed-subqualifiers-related-to-other-requirements}}

If a diagnostic horizon or a layer with a diagnostic property belongs to
a buried soil (see Chapter~2.4), the \textbf{Thapto-} (from Greek
\emph{thaptein}, to bury) specifier can be used to construct
\textbf{optional or additional subqualifiers}. If used with a principal
qualifier, the Thapto- subqualifier \textbf{must shift to the
supplementary qualifiers} and be placed within the list of the
supplementary qualifiers according to the alphabetical position of the
qualifier, not the subqualifier.

For soils with a limiting layer, a geomembrane or a continuous layer of
\emph{artefacts}, \textbf{additional subqualifiers} with the
\textbf{Supra-} (from Latin \emph{supra}, above) specifier can be
constructed to describe the soil material above, if the thickness or
depth requirements of a qualifier or of its respective diagnostics are
not fulfilled, but all other criteria are fulfilled throughout in the
soil material above (e.g.~Ekranic Technosol (Suprafolic)). If the Supra-
specifier is used, the Epi- specifier is not used.

\hypertarget{subqualifiers-with-a-given-definition}{%
\subsection{Subqualifiers with a given
definition}\label{subqualifiers-with-a-given-definition}}

\textbf{For some qualifiers, subqualifiers are defined in Chapter~5},
e.g., Hypersalic and Protosalic for the Salic qualifier. These
\textbf{subqualifiers are not listed with the RSGs in Chapter~4} (unless
the qualifier without specifier cannot exist for the respective RSG).
They belong to the \textbf{optional} (e.g.~Hypercalcic, Orthomineralic),
the \textbf{additional} (e.g.~Akromineralic) or the \textbf{mandatory}
(e.g.~Protocalcic) subqualifiers. If the Proto- specifier is used with a
principal qualifier, the Proto- subqualifier \textbf{must shift to the
supplementary qualifiers} and be placed within the list of the
supplementary qualifiers according to the alphabetical position of the
qualifier, not the subqualifier.

If of one qualifier, two or more subqualifiers with a given definition
apply (e.g.~Anthromollic and Tonguimollic), they \textbf{have to be
listed all}. Adding a further specifier to a subqualifier with a given
definition is also allowed, e.g., Endoprotosalic, Supraprotosodic.

\hypertarget{buried-soils}{%
\section{Buried soils}\label{buried-soils}}

A buried soil is a soil covered by younger deposits. Where a soil is
buried, the following rules apply:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  The overlying material and the buried soil are classified as one soil
  if both together qualify as a Histosol, Anthrosol, Technosol, Cryosol,
  Leptosol, Vertisol, Gleysol, Andosol, Planosol, Stagnosol, Arenosol,
  Fluvisol or Regosol.
\item
  Otherwise, the overlying material is classified with preference if it
  is ≥~50~cm thick or if the overlying material, if it stood alone,
  satisfies the requirements of a RSG other than a Regosol. For depth
  requirements in the overlying material, the lower limit of the
  overlying material is regarded as if it were the upper limit of
  \emph{continuous rock}.
\item
  In all other cases, the buried soil is classified with preference. For
  depth requirements in the buried soil, the upper limit of the buried
  soil is regarded as its soil surface.
\item
  If the overlying soil is classified with preference, there are two
  options to consider the underlying soil:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    If the underlying soil is not a Regosol or Leptosol and shows a
    complete horizon sequence, including clearly identifiable organic
    surface layers and/or mineral topsoil horizons, and one soil does
    not influence the pedogenic processes in the other soil,
    respectively (e.g.~no clay migration from the overlying into the
    underlying soil, no Fe transport by capillary upward movement from
    the underlying into the overlying soil), then the name of the buried
    soil is placed after the name of the overlying soil adding the word
    `over' in between, e.g.~Skeletic Umbrisol (Siltic) over Albic Podzol
    (Arenic). As many buried soils are polygenetic, qualifiers that are
    not in the list for the particular RSG may be applicable. If so,
    these qualifiers must be used as supplementary qualifiers. The
    qualifiers Infraandic and Infraspodic are provided for buried soils
    only and are therefore not listed with the RSGs in Chapter~4.
  \item
    Otherwise, a buried diagnostic horizon or a buried layer with a
    diagnostic property is added with the Thapto- subqualifier to the
    name of the overlying soil (see Chapter~2.3).
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  If the buried soil is classified with preference, the overlying
  material is indicated with the Novic qualifier. If applicable, the
  Novic qualifier is combined with certain other qualifiers in the
  following way (codes in brackets); thickness and depth criteria of
  these qualifiers do not need to be fulfilled:\\
  Aeoli-Novic (nva)\\
  Fluvi-Novic (nvf)\\
  Solimovi-Novic (nvs)\\
  Techni-Novic (nvt)\\
  Tephri-Novic (nvv)\\
  Transporti-Novic. (nvp)\\
  In addition, according to Chapter 5, the texture may also be added,
  e.g., Aeoli-Siltinovic (sja).
\end{enumerate}

The following guidelines apply:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  A map unit consists of

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a dominant soil only
  \item
    a dominant soil plus a codominant soil and/or one or more associated
    soils
  \item
    two or three codominant soils
  \item
    two or three codominant soils plus one or more associated soils.\\
    \strut \\
    Dominant soils represent ≥~50\% of the soil cover, codominant soils
    ≥ 25 and \textless~50\% of the soil cover. Associated soils
    represent ≥~5 and \textless~25\% of the soil cover or are of high
    relevance in the landscape ecology. The other soils should be
    ignored in the denomination of the map unit.\\
    \strut \\
    If codominant or associated soils are indicated, the words
    `dominant:', `codominant:' and `associated:' are written before the
    name of the soil; the soils are separated by semicolons.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The number of qualifiers specified below refers to the dominant soil.
  For codominant or associated soils, fewer numbers of qualifiers (or
  even no qualifier) may be appropriate.
\item
  Depending on scale, different numbers of principal qualifiers are
  used:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For very small map scales, only the Reference Soil Group (RSG) is
    used.
  \item
    For next larger map scales, the RSG plus the first applicable

    \strut \\
    It is not possible to give general numbers for these scales, because
    this depends very much on the homogeneity or heterogeneity of the
    landscape. In landscapes of intermediate homogeneity, very small
    scales would be smaller than 1~: ~10~000~000, the next larger scales
    smaller than 1~:~5~000~000 and the next larger scales smaller than
    1~:~1~000~000.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  If there are fewer qualifiers applicable than described above, the
  lesser number is used.
\item
  Depending on the purpose of the map or according to national
  traditions, at any scale level, further qualifiers may be added as
  \textbf{elective qualifiers}. These may be principal qualifiers from
  further down the list and not already used in the soil name, or they
  may be supplementary qualifiers. They are placed using the
  above-mentioned rules for supplementary qualifiers. If two or more
  elective qualifiers are used, the following rules apply:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    the principal qualifiers are placed first, and of them, the first
    applicable qualifier is placed first, and
  \item
    the sequence of any supplementary qualifiers added is decided by the
    soil scientist who makes the map.

\hypertarget{example-1}{%
\paragraph{Example 1}\label{example-1}}

A map unit dominated by a soil with a very dark mineral surface horizon,
30~cm thick, with high base saturation, no secondary carbonates and
groundwater influence starting at 60~cm from the mineral soil surface
(i.e.~having a layer, ≥~25~cm thick, that has gleyic properties
throughout and reducing conditions in some parts of every sublayer),
will be named as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  at the first map scale level: Phaeozems
\item
  at the second map scale level: Chernic Phaeozems
\item
  at the third map scale level: Gleyic Chernic Phaeozems
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{example-2}{%
\paragraph{Example 2}\label{example-2}}

In a map unit, no diagnostics apply. In 80\% of the area, the soil has
\textless~40\% coarse fragments as a weighted average in the uppermost
100 cm, in the other 20\% of the area, the soil has 85\% coarse
fragments as a weighted average in the uppermost 75~cm. The soils are
calcareous and silty. This map unit will be named as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  at the first map scale level: dominant: Regosols associated: Leptosols
\item
  at the second map scale level: dominant: Calcaric Regosols associated:
  Coarsic Leptosols
\item
  at the third map scale level: dominant: Calcaric Regosols associated:
  Calcaric Coarsic Leptosols
\end{itemize}

In this example, the next applicable qualifier for the Regosols is
Eutric. However, as high base saturation is already indicated by the
Calcaric qualifier, the Eutric qualifier is redundant. Therefore, in
this case, only one principal qualifier is applicable at the third map
scale level. For associated soils, it is allowed to use fewer qualifiers
than indicated for the scale level. If appropriate, at the third scale
level, the Leptosols may just be named Coarsic Leptosols.

The high silt content may be expressed by the Siltic qualifier, which as
a supplementary qualifier is elective in a map legend. It may be added
at any scale level, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  at the first map scale level: Regosols (Siltic)
\item
  at the second map scale level: Calcaric Regosols (Siltic)
\end{itemize}

Principal qualifiers, not required at the respective scale level, may
also be added as elective qualifiers, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  at the first map scale level: Regosols (Calcaric, Siltic)
\item
  at the second map scale level: Calcaric Regosols (Siltic)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{example-3}{%
\paragraph{Example 3}\label{example-3}}

A map unit, dominated by a soil with a thick layer of strongly
decomposed acidic \emph{organic material}, 70~cm thick and filled with
rainwater, with continuous rock at 80~cm will be named as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  at the first map scale level: Histosols
\item
  at the second map scale level: Sapric Histosols
\item
  at the third map scale level: Leptic Sapric Histosols
\end{itemize}

In this example, the next applicable qualifier is Ombric. As two
qualifiers are already used, the third may be added as elective
qualifier. In a similar way, elective qualifiers may be used at the
other scale levels, for example:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  at the first map scale level: Histosols (Sapric)
\item
  at the second map scale level: Sapric Histosols (Leptic, Ombric)
\item
  at the third map scale level: Leptic Sapric Histosols (Ombric)

{\textbf{Before using the diagnostic horizons, properties and materials,
please read the `Rules for naming soils' (Chapter 2).}}

Throughout the following text, references to the RSGs defined in Chapter
4 and to the diagnostics listed elsewhere in this Chapter are shown in
\emph{italics}.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-horizons}{%
\section{Diagnostic horizons}\label{diagnostic-horizons}}

\textbf{Diagnostic horizons} are characterized by a combination of
attributes that reflect widespread, common results of soil-forming
processes. Their features can be observed or measured in the field or
the laboratory and require a minimum or maximum expression to qualify as
diagnostic. In addition, diagnostic horizons require a certain minimum
thickness, thus forming a recognizable layer in the soil.

\hypertarget{albic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Albic horizon}\label{albic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description}}

An albic horizon (from Latin \emph{albus}, white) is a light-coloured
horizon overlying an \emph{argic}, \emph{natric}, \emph{plinthic} or
\emph{spodic horizon} or forming part of a layer with \emph{stagnic
properties}. It has low contents of Fe and Mn (depleted from both
oxidized and reduced forms) and of organic matter, and at least one of
these substances has previously been present and was lost due to clay
migration, podzolization, and/or redox processes caused by water
stagnation.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria}}

An albic horizon consists of \emph{mineral material} and

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  consists of \emph{claric material};\\
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  one or both of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    overlies an \emph{argic}, \emph{natric}, \emph{plinthic} or
    \emph{spodic horizon}; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    forms part of a layer with \emph{stagnic properties};\\
    \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  has a thickness of ≥~1~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{additional-information}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information}}

Albic horizons are normally overlain by humus-enriched surface layers
but may also be at the mineral soil surface as a result of erosion or
artificial removal of the surface layer. Many albic horizons represent a
strong expression of eluviation and are therefore called eluvial
horizons. In sandy materials, albic horizons can reach considerable
thickness, up to several metres, especially in humid tropical regions,
and underlying diagnostic horizons may be hard to establish. Albic
horizons generally have a weakly expressed soil aggregate structure, a
single grain structure or a massive structure. Albic horizons are widely
depleted from Fe, both the oxidized and the reduced forms, and typically
do not show red colours when applying α,α-dipyridyl solution.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics}}

While the albic horizon is the result of soil-forming processes, the
\emph{claric material} is only defined by colour criteria, and layers
with \emph{claric material} may or may not have undergone soil-forming
processes. The definition of the albic horizon uses the \emph{argic},
\emph{natric}, \emph{plinthic} or \emph{spodic horizon} or the
\emph{stagnic properties} as criterion. The definitions of the
\emph{spodic horizon} and of the \emph{retic} and \emph{stagnic
properties}, in turn, use the \emph{claric material} as criterion.

Many albic horizons that were formed by stagnant water do not show
active \emph{reducing conditions}.

\hypertarget{anthraquic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Anthraquic horizon}\label{anthraquic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-1}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-1}}

An anthraquic horizon (from Greek \emph{anthropos}, human being, and
Latin \emph{aqua}, water) is a surface horizon that results from
wet-field cultivation and comprises a \emph{puddled layer} and a
\emph{plough pan}.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-1}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-1}}

An anthraquic horizon is a surface horizon consisting of \emph{mineral
material} and has:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  a puddled layer with the following Munsell colours, moist, in ≥~80\%
  of its exposed area:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}

  \item
    a hue of 7.5YR or yellower, a value of ≤~4 and a chroma of ≤~2;

    layer;\\
    \textbf{\emph{and}}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\roman{enumiii}.}

    \item
      are predominantly on biopore walls and, if soil aggregates are
      present, predominantly on or adjacent to aggregate surfaces;
      \textbf{\emph{and}}
    \item
      have a Munsell colour hue ≥~2.5 units redder and a chroma ≥~1 unit
      higher, moist, than the surrounding material;\\
      \textbf{\emph{and}}
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  a thickness of ≥~15~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification}}

An anthraquic horizon shows evidence of reduction and oxidation owing to
flooding for part of the year. When not flooded, it is very dispersible
and has a loose packing of sorted small soil aggregates. The plough pan
is compact, has a platy or massive structure and a very low infiltration
rate. It has a reduced matrix and yellowish-brown, brown or
reddish-brown oximorphic features along cracks and root channels due to
oxygen release from plant roots.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-1}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

After a long time of wet-field cultivation, a \emph{hydragric horizon}
develops under the anthraquic horizon.

\hypertarget{argic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Argic horizon}\label{argic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-2}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-2}}

An argic horizon (from Latin \emph{argilla}, white clay) is a subsurface
horizon with a distinctly higher clay content than the overlying
horizon. The textural differentiation may be caused by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  an illuvial accumulation of clay mineral
\item
  predominant pedogenic formation of clay minerals in the subsoil
\item
  destruction of clay minerals in the overlying horizon
\item
  selective surface erosion of clay minerals
\item
  upward movement of coarser particles due to swelling and shrinking
\item
  biological activity, or
\item
  a combination of two or more of these different processes.
\end{itemize}

Iron (hydr)oxides are often accumulated or formed together with clay
minerals, giving the argic horizon a redder hue and/or a higher chroma.

A clay-richer stratum overlain by a clay-poorer stratum may resemble an
argic horizon. However, a textural difference due only to a \emph{lithic
discontinuity} does not qualify as an argic horizon. In some soils, we
may have both: a clay-poorer stratum overlying a clay-richer stratum and
additionally a textural differentiation caused by soil-forming
processes.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-2}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-2}}

An argic horizon consists of \emph{mineral material} and:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item
      a ratio of fine clay to total clay in the argic horizon greater by
      ≥~1.2 times than the ratio in the overlying coarser-textured

    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}

  \item

  \end{enumerate}

  \item
    ≥~7.5~cm (if composed of lamellae: combined thickness within 50~cm

  \item
    ≥~15~cm (if composed of lamellae: combined thickness within 50~cm of
    the upper limit of the uppermost lamella).
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-1}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-1}}

Textural differentiation and the evidence of clay illuviation are the
main features of argic horizons. The recognition of clay coatings and
clay bridges is explained in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.23).

In shrink-swell soils, clay coatings at soil aggregate surfaces are
easily confused with pressure faces (stress cutans). Pressure faces do
not differ in colour from the original aggregate and do not occur on
coarse fragments and biopore walls.

\hypertarget{additional-information-1}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-1}}

The illuvial character of an argic horizon can best be established using
thin sections. Diagnostic illuvial argic horizons show areas with
oriented clay bodies that constitute on average ≥~1\% of the entire
cross-section. Other tests involved are particle-size distribution
analysis to determine the increase in clay content over a specified
depth, and the fine clay/total clay ratio. In illuvial argic horizons,
the fine clay to total clay ratio is larger than in the overlying
horizons, due to preferential transport of fine clay particles.

If the soil shows a lithic discontinuity directly over the argic
horizon, or if the surface horizon has been removed by erosion, or if a
plough layer directly overlies the argic horizon, then the illuvial
nature must be clearly established (diagnostic criterion 2.b).

The argic horizon may be subdivided into several lamellae with
coarser-textured layers in between.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-2}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-2}}

Argic horizons are normally situated below eluvial horizons
i.e.~horizons from which clay minerals have been removed, commonly
together with oxides and some organic matter. Although initially formed
as a subsurface horizon, argic horizons may occur at the mineral soil
surface as a result of erosion or removal of the overlying horizons.
Afterwards, new sediments may be added.

Some argic horizons fulfil all the diagnostic criteria of the
\emph{ferralic horizon}. Ferralsols must have a \emph{ferralic horizon}
and may have an argic horizon as well, which may or may not overlap with
the \emph{ferralic horizon}; but if an argic horizon is present, it must
have in its upper 30~cm: \textless~10\% water-dispersible clay or a ΔpH
(pH\textsubscript{KCl} - pH\textsubscript{water}) ≥~0 or ≥~1.4\%
\emph{soil organic carbon}.

Argic horizons lack the sodium saturation characteristics of the
\emph{natric horizon}.

Argic horizons in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in
humid tropical and subtropical regions may occur in association with
\emph{sombric horizons}.

\hypertarget{calcic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Calcic horizon}\label{calcic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-3}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-3}}

A calcic horizon (from Latin \emph{calx}, lime) is a horizon in which
secondary calcium carbonate (CaCO\textsubscript{3}) has accumulated as
discontinuous concentrations. The accumulation usually occurs in
subsurface layers, or more rarely, in surface horizons. The calcic
horizon may contain primary carbonates as well.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-3}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-3}}

A calcic horizon:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  has a calcium carbonate equivalent of ≥~15\% (related to the fine
  earth plus accumulations of secondary carbonates of any size and any
  cementation class);\\
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  one or both of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    meets the diagnostic criteria of \emph{protocalcic properties};
    \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    has a calcium carbonate equivalent of ≥~5\% higher (absolute,
    related to the fine earth plus accumulations of secondary carbonates
    of any size and any cementation class) than that of an underlying
    layer and no \emph{lithic discontinuity} between the two layers;
    \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  does not form part of a \emph{petrocalcic horizon};\\
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has a thickness of ≥~15~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-2}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-2}}

Calcium carbonate can be identified in the field using 1~\emph{M}
hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution. The degree of effervescence is an
indication of its amount (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.4.25).

Secondary carbonates are visible as usually discrete permanent
accumulations (see Annex 1, Chapter 8.4.25). In the calcic horizon, they
are predominantly non-cemented or less than moderately cemented.
However, discontinuous accumulations, which are moderately or more
cemented, may also occur.

Other possible indications of a calcic horizon are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  white, pinkish to reddish, or grey colours (if not overlapping
  horizons rich in organic carbon)
\item
  a low porosity (interaggregate porosity is usually less than in the
  horizon directly above, and possibly also less than in the horizon
  directly below).
\end{itemize}

When sampling, please make sure that the sample includes the
accumulations of secondary carbonates in order to obtain the laboratory
data for criteria 1 and 2.b.

\hypertarget{additional-information-2}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-2}}

The determination of carbonates in the laboratory (Annex~2, Chapter~9.9)
uses an acid and measures the evolved CO\textsubscript{2}. It may stem
from various carbonates, but the carbonate content is calculated as if
it were only from calcium carbonate. This is called the \textbf{calcium
carbonate equivalent}.

Determination of the amount of calcium carbonate (by mass) and the
changes of calcium carbonate content within the soil profile are the
main analytical criteria for establishing the presence of a calcic
horizon. \emph{Lithic discontinuities} and any change of water
permeability may favour the formation of secondary carbonates.
Determination of pH\textsubscript{water} enables distinction between
accumulations with a basic (\emph{calcic}) character (pH~8-8.7) due to
the dominance of CaCO\textsubscript{3}, and those with an ultrabasic
(\emph{non-calcic}) character (pH~\textgreater~8.7) because of the
presence of Na\textsubscript{2}CO\textsubscript{3} and/or
MgCO\textsubscript{3}.

In addition, the analysis of thin sections may reveal the presence of
calcium carbonate pedofeatures (e.g.~nodules, pendents) or evidence of
silicate epigenesis (calcite pseudomorphs after primary minerals),
besides evidences of removal of carbonates in layers above or below the
calcic horizon.

If the accumulation of soft carbonates is such that all or most of the
soil structure and/or rock structure disappears and continuous
concentrations of calcium carbonate prevail, the Hypercalcic qualifier
is used.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-3}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-3}}

When calcic horizons become continuously cemented with a cementation
class of at least moderately cemented, transition takes place to the
\emph{petrocalcic horizon}, the expression of which may be massive or
platy. A calcic horizon and a \emph{petrocalcic horizon} may overlie
each other.

Accumulations of secondary carbonates, not qualifying for a calcic
horizon, may fulfil the diagnostic criteria of \emph{protocalcic
properties}, which are fulfilled by most calcic horizons as well.
\emph{Calcaric material} includes primary carbonates.

In dry regions and in the presence of sulfate-bearing soil or
groundwater solutions, calcic horizons occur associated with
\emph{gypsic horizons}. Calcic and \emph{gypsic horizons} typically (but
not always) occupy different positions in the soil profile because
gypsum is more soluble than calcium carbonate, and they can normally be
distinguished clearly from each other by a difference in crystal
morphology. Gypsum crystals tend to be needle-shaped, usually visible to
the naked eye, whereas pedogenic calcium carbonate crystals are much
finer in size.

\hypertarget{general-description-4}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-4}}

A cambic horizon (from Latin \emph{cambire}, to change) is a subsurface
horizon showing evidence of soil formation that ranges from weak to
relatively strong. The cambic horizon shows soil aggregate structure at
least in half of the volume of the fine earth. If the underlying layer
has the same parent material, the cambic horizon usually shows higher
oxide and/or clay contents than this underlying layer and/or evidence of
removal of carbonates and/or gypsum. The soil formation in a cambic
horizon can also be established by contrast with one of the overlying
mineral horizons that are generally richer in organic matter and
therefore have a darker and/or less intense colour.

\hypertarget{additional-characteristics}{%
\subsubsection{Additional
characteristics}\label{additional-characteristics}}

In many cambic horizons, Fe oxides are formed, which give the horizon a
redder hue and a higher chroma. However, if the parent material has much
hematite, the formation of goethite in cooler and humid conditions
usually makes it yellower.

Dissolution of carbonates or gypsum is a widespread feature of cambic
horizons in both humid and semi-arid environments. In many cases, this
may be proven by a lesser carbonate or gypsum content compared to the
underlying layer. However, in some soils, especially in arid and
semi-arid areas, this lesser content is not evident. In these soils, the
presence of \emph{protocalcic} or \emph{protogypsic properties} in the
underlying layer is a proof that carbonates or gypsum have been
dissolved in the horizon above. On the other hand, such accumulations
may also be caused by ascending groundwater in soils with \emph{gleyic
properties}, and \emph{gleyic properties} have to be excluded in the
underlying layer for this comparison.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-4}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-4}}

The cambic horizon can be considered the predecessor of many other
diagnostic horizons, all of which have specific properties that are not
or only weakly expressed in the cambic horizon -- such as illuvial or
residual accumulations, removal of substances other than carbonates or
gypsum, accumulation of soluble components, or the development of
specific soil structure like wedge-shaped aggregates.

Cambic horizons in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains
in humid tropical and subtropical regions may occur in association with
\emph{sombric horizons}. The ratio between Fe\textsubscript{ox} and
Fe\textsubscript{dith} differentiates the cambic horizon from the
\emph{tsitelic horizon} (higher ratio). The \emph{plinthic} and the
\emph{petroplinthic horizon} have usually much higher
Fe\textsubscript{dith} contents.

\hypertarget{general-description-5}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-5}}

A chernic horizon (from Russian \emph{chorniy}, black) is a relatively

\hypertarget{field-identification-3}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-3}}

A chernic horizon may easily be identified by its blackish colour,
caused by the accumulation of organic matter, its well-developed
granular or subangular blocky structure, an indication of high base
saturation (e.g.~pH\textsubscript{water} \textgreater~6), and its
thickness.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-5}{%

The chernic horizon is a special case of the \emph{mollic horizon} with
a higher content of \emph{soil organic carbon}, a lower chroma,
generally better developed soil structure, a minimum content of fine
earth and a greater minimum thickness. The upper limit of the content of
\emph{soil organic carbon} is 20\%, which is the lower limit for
\emph{organic material}.

\hypertarget{cohesic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Cohesic horizon}\label{cohesic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-6}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-6}}

A cohesic horizon (from Latin \emph{cohaerere}, to stick together) is a
subsurface horizon with a massive structure or a subangular blocky
structure. It is poor in organic matter and iron oxides, normally
contains quartz, and the clay fraction is dominated by kaolinite. It is
typical for old landscapes of the tropics with a seasonal climate.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-6}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-6}}

A cohesic horizon consists of \emph{mineral material} and:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  has \textless~0.5\% \emph{soil organic carbon}; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has ≥~15\% clay; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has a CEC (by 1~\emph{M} NH\textsubscript{4}OAc, pH~7) of \textless~24

  is not cemented; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has, when dry, a rupture-resistance class of at least hard;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has a thickness of ≥~10~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-4}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-4}}

Cohesic horizons are very resistant to penetration of knife or hammer
and have a rupture-resistance class of hard to extremely hard when dry,
becoming friable or firm when moist.

\hypertarget{additional-information-3}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-3}}

Cohesic horizons have a porosity low enough to restrict root
penetration, but drainage is usually not restricted. The low porosity is
attributed to parallel orientation of kaolinite crystals and infilling
of voids by clay particles. Usually, they have a bulk density higher
than the over- and underlying layers. They are typically found directly
below a surface horizon.

Many soils with the cohesic horizon have the Caráter coeso in the
Brazilian system and have an apedal B horizon in the South African
system. Cohesic horizons may also occur in paleosols.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-6}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

Cohesic horizons may coincide with \emph{ferralic} or, less widespread,
with \emph{argic horizons}. They differ strongly from \emph{nitic
horizons}. Some cohesic horizons show active or relict \emph{stagnic

\emph{petroplinthic horizon}.

A cryic horizon (from Greek \emph{kryos}, cold, ice) is a perennially
frozen soil horizon in \emph{mineral} or \emph{organic material}.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-7}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-7}}

A cryic horizon has:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\item
  continuously for ≥~2 consecutive years one of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    massive ice, cementation by ice or readily visible ice crystals;
    \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    a soil temperature of \textless~0~°C and insufficient water to form
    readily visible ice crystals;\\
    \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  a thickness of ≥~5~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-5}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-5}}

Cryic horizons occur in areas with permafrost and most of them show
evidence of perennial ice segregation. Many of them are overlain by
horizons with evidence of cryogenic alteration (mixed soil material,
disrupted soil horizons, involutions, organic intrusions, frost heave,
separation of coarse fragments from fine earth, cracks). Patterned
surface features (earth hummocks, frost mounds, stone circles, stripes,
nets and polygons) are common. To identify cryogenic alteration, a soil
profile should intersect different elements of patterned ground, if
present, or be wider than 2~m.

Soils that contain saline water do not freeze at 0~°C. In order to
develop a cryic horizon, such soils must be cold enough to freeze.

\hypertarget{additional-information-4}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-4}}

Permafrost is defined as follows: layer of soil or rock, at some depth
beneath the surface, in which the temperature has been continuously
below 0~°C for at least some years. It exists where summer heating fails
to reach the base of the layer of frozen ground (Arctic Climatology and
Meteorology Glossary, National Snow and Ice Data Center, Boulder, USA).

Engineers distinguish between \emph{warm} and \emph{cold} permafrost.
\emph{Warm} permafrost has a temperature \textgreater~-2~°C and has to
be considered unstable. \emph{Cold} permafrost has a temperature of
≤~-2~°C and can be used more safely for construction purposes provided
the temperature remains under control.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-7}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

Cryic horizons may fulfil the diagnostic criteria of \emph{histic},
\emph{folic} or \emph{spodic horizons} and may occur in association with
\emph{salic}, \emph{calcic}, \emph{mollic} or \emph{umbric horizons}. In
cold arid regions, \emph{yermic properties} may be present.

\hypertarget{general-description-8}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-8}}

A duric horizon (from Latin \emph{durus}, hard) is a subsurface horizon
showing nodules or concretions (durinodes), cemented by silica
(SiO\textsubscript{2}), presumably in the form of opal and
microcrystalline silica. Many durinodes have carbonate coatings. It may
also contain fragments of a broken-up \emph{petroduric horizon}.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-8}{%

A duric horizon consists of \emph{mineral material} and has:

    accumulation of visible secondary silica; \textbf{\emph{and}}

  \item
    have a diameter of ≥~1~cm; \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  a thickness of ≥~10~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-6}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-6}}

The identification of secondary silica is described in Annex~1 (Chapter
8.4.27). The durinodes are usually hard (high penetration resistance).
Many durinodes are brittle when moist, both before and after treatment
with acid.

\hypertarget{additional-information-5}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-5}}

Dry durinodes do not slake appreciably in water, but prolonged soaking
can result in the breaking-off of very thin platelets and some slaking.
In cross-section, most durinodes are roughly concentric, and concentric
stringers of opal may be visible under a hand lens.

If both silica and carbonates are present as cementing agents, the
durinodes will only slake if hot concentrated KOH or NaOH (to dissolve
the silica) are alternated with HCl (to dissolve the carbonates). If
carbonates are absent, KOH or NaOH alone will be able to slake the
durinodes.

In arid regions, duric horizons occur in association with \emph{gypsic},

horizon continuously cemented by silica is a \emph{petroduric horizon}.

\hypertarget{ferralic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Ferralic horizon}\label{ferralic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-9}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-9}}

A ferralic horizon (from Latin \emph{ferrum}, iron, and \emph{alumen},
alum) is a subsurface horizon resulting from long and intense
weathering. The clay fraction is dominated by low-activity clays and
contains various amounts of resistant minerals such as (hydr-)oxides of
Fe, Al, Mn and Ti. There may be a marked residual accumulation of quartz
in the silt or sand fractions.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-9}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-9}}

A ferralic horizon consists of mineral material and:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  has a texture class of sandy loam or finer and ≥~8\% clay; and
\item
  has \textless{} 80\% (by volume, related to the whole soil) coarse
  fragments, pisoplinthic concretions or nodules or remnants of a
  petroplinthic horizon; and
\item
  has a CEC (by 1 M NH4OAc, pH 7) of \textless{} 16 cmolc kg-1 clay; and
\item
  has \textless{} 10\% (by grain count) easily weatherable minerals in
  the 0.05--0.2 mm fraction; and
\item
  does not have andic or vitric properties; and
\item
  6. has a thickness of ≥ 30 cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-7}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-7}}

Ferralic horizons are associated with old and stable landforms. The
macrostructure is moderate to weak but typical ferralic horizons have a
strong microaggregation.

Ferralic horizons rich in Fe oxides (especially rich in hematite) have
usually a friable rupture-resistance class, moist. Disrupted dry soil
material flows like flour between the fingers. Lumps of ferralic
horizons are usually relatively light in mass because of the low bulk
density. Many ferralic horizons give a hollow sound when tapped,
indicating high porosity. In some ferralic horizons, the high porosity
is the result of termite activity. Generally, the voids between the
microaggregates provide a high porosity.

If the ferralic horizon has less hematite and a more yellowish colour,
it typically shows a higher bulk density and a lower porosity. It is
massive or has a weak subangular blocky structure and a firm
rupture-resistance class, moist.

Indicators of clay illuviation such as clay coatings are generally
absent or rare, as are pressure faces and other stress features.
Boundaries of a ferralic horizon are normally gradual to diffuse, and
little variation in colour or particle-size distribution within the
horizon can be detected.

\hypertarget{additional-information-6}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-6}}

As an alternative to the weatherable minerals requirement, a total
reserve of bases (TRB = exchangeable plus mineral calcium {[}Ca{]},
magnesium {[}Mg{]}, potassium {[}K{]} and sodium {[}Na{]}) of
\textless~25~cmol\textsubscript{c}~kg\textsuperscript{-1} soil may be
indicative.

Ferralic horizons normally have \textless~10\% water-dispersible clay.
Occasionally they may have more waterdispersible clay, but if so, they
have a ΔpH (pH\textsubscript{KCl} - pH\textsubscript{water}) ≥~0 or a
relatively high content of organic carbon.

Examples of easily weatherable minerals are all 2:1 phyllosilicates,
chlorites, sepiolites, palygorskites, allophanes, 1:1 trioctahedral
phyllosilicates (serpentines), feldspars, feldspathoids, ferromagnesian
minerals, glass, zeolites, dolomite and apatite. The intent of the term
weatherable minerals is to include those minerals that are unstable in
humid climates compared with other minerals, such as quartz and 1:1~clay
minerals, but that are more resistant to weathering than calcite (Soil
Survey Staff, 1999).

In thin sections, ferralic horizons have generally an undifferentiated
b-fabric due to the isotropic behaviour of Fe oxides. The groundmass has
commonly a granular microstructure, with a porosity composed by packing
pores and star-like vughs, besides channels and chambers due to a strong
bioturbation.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-9}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-9}}

Some \emph{argic horizons} fulfil all the diagnostic criteria of the
ferralic horizon.

Al\textsubscript{ox}, Fe\textsubscript{ox}, Si\textsubscript{ox} in
ferralic horizons are very low, which sets them apart from the
\emph{nitic horizons} and layers with \emph{andic} or \emph{vitric
properties}.

Some \emph{cambic horizons} have a low CEC; however, the amount of
weatherable minerals or the TRB is too high for a ferralic horizon. Such
horizons represent an advanced stage of weathering and a transition to
the ferralic horizon.

Ferralic horizons in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains
in humid tropical and subtropical regions may occur in association with
\emph{sombric horizons}.

Due to redox processes, ferralic horizons may develop into
\emph{plinthic horizons}. Most \emph{plinthic horizons} also fulfil the
diagnostic criteria of ferralic horizons.

\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-10}}

A ferric horizon (from Latin \emph{ferrum}, iron) has formed by redox
processes, usually caused by stagnant water, which may be active or
relict, and shows redoximorphic features. The segregation of Fe (or Fe
and Mn) has advanced to such an extent that oximorphic features (coarse
masses or discrete concretions and/or nodules) have formed inside soil
aggregates, and the matrix between them is largely depleted of Fe and
Mn. They do not necessarily have enhanced Fe (or Fe and Mn) contents,
but Fe (or Fe and Mn) are concentrated in the oximorphic features.
Generally, such segregation leads to poor aggregation of the soil
particles in Fe- and Mn-depleted zones and a compaction of the horizon.
It mainly occurs in old landscapes.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-10}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-10}}

A ferric horizon consists of \emph{mineral material} and:

\begin{enumerate}

  \begin{enumerate}

  \item
    ≥~15\% of its exposed area occupied by coarse (\textgreater~20~mm,
    average length of the greatest dimension) masses inside soil

    7.5YR and a chroma of ≥~5, both moist; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    ≥~5\% of its exposed area (related to the fine earth plus
    concretions and/or nodules of any size and cementation class)
    occupied by concretions and/or nodules with a cementation class of
    at least weakly cemented, a reddish and/or blackish colour and a
    diameter of \textgreater~2~mm; \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  does not form part of a \emph{petroplinthic}, \emph{pisoplinthic} or
  \emph{plinthic horizon}; \textbf{\emph{and}}

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-10}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-10}}

In tropical or subtropical regions, ferric horizons may grade laterally
into \emph{plinthic horizons}. In \emph{plinthic horizons}, the amount
of oximorphic features reaches ≥~15\% (by exposed area). Additionally,
in \emph{plinthic horizons}, a certain content of Fe\textsubscript{dith}
is exceeded and/or it changes irreversibly to a continuously cemented
layer on exposure to repeated drying and wetting with free access of
oxygen. If the amount of concretions and/or nodules with a cementation
class of at least moderately cemented reaches ≥~40\% (by exposed area),
it is a \emph{pisoplinthic horizon}.

\hypertarget{folic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Folic horizon}\label{folic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-11}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-11}}

A folic horizon (from Latin \emph{folium}, leaf) consists of
well-aerated \emph{organic material}. It develops at the soil surface.
In places, it may be covered by \emph{mineral material}. Folic horizons
predominantly occur in cool climate or at high elevation.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-11}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-11}}

A folic horizon consists of \emph{organic material} and:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  is saturated with water for \textless~30 consecutive days in most
  years and is not drained; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has a thickness of ≥~10~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-11}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-11}}

The folic horizon has characteristics similar to the \emph{histic
horizon}. However, the \emph{histic horizon} forms while saturated with
water consecutively for at least 30 days in most years, which causes a
completely different vegetation and therefore a different character of
the \emph{organic material}.

The \emph{organic material} sets the folic horizon apart from
\emph{chernic}, \emph{mollic} or \emph{umbric horizons}, which consist
of \emph{mineral material}. Folic horizons may show \emph{andic} or
\emph{vitric properties}.

\hypertarget{fragic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Fragic horizon}\label{fragic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-12}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-12}}

A fragic horizon (from Latin \emph{fragilis}, fragile) is a natural,
predominantly non-cemented subsurface horizon with large soil aggregates
and a porosity pattern such that roots and percolating water penetrate
the soil only in between these aggregates. The natural character
excludes plough pans and surface traffic pans.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-12}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-12}}

A fragic horizon consists of \emph{mineral material} and:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  ≥~60\% (by volume) consist, single or in combination, of prismatic,
  columnar, angular or subangular blocky soil aggregates that are
  without coarse roots and that have an average horizontal spacing
  (aggregate centre to aggregate centre) of ≥~10~cm; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  shows evidence of soil formation as defined in criterion~3 of the
  \emph{cambic horizon}, at least on the faces of the soil aggregates;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  the soil material in between the soil aggregates and ≥~50\% of the
  volume of the aggregated soil are not cemented; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  the non-cemented parts do not cement upon repeated drying and wetting;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  the non-cemented aggregated parts have a brittle manner of failure and
  a rupture-resistance class, moist, of at least firm;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has \textless~0.5\% soil organic carbon; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  does not show effervescence after adding a 1~\emph{M}~HCl solution;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has a thickness of ≥~15~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-8}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-8}}

A fragic horizon has a prismatic and/or blocky structure. In some fragic
horizons, the soil aggregates have a high bulk density. In others, the
inner parts of the aggregates may have a relatively high total porosity
but, as a result of a dense outer rim, there is no continuity between
the pores within and outside the aggregates. Between the prisms or the
angular blocks, a weaker aggregate structure or a massive structure and
mostly also a lighter soil colour is found. The result is a closed box
system with ≥~60\% of the soil volume that cannot be explored by roots
and is not percolated by water. Possible reasons for the dense outer rim
are: clay coatings, swelling and shrinking, or the pressure of the roots
growing only vertically.

It is essential that the required soil volume is inspected from both
vertical and horizontal sections; horizontal sections often reveal a
polygonal pattern. Three or four such polygons (or a cut up to
1~m\textsuperscript{2}) are sufficient to test the volumetric basis for
the definition of the fragic horizon.

Fragic horizons are commonly loamy, but loamy sand and clay textures are
not excluded. In the latter case, the clay mineralogy is dominantly
kaolinitic.

The aggregates have commonly a penetration resistance ≥~4~MPa at field
capacity.

The fragic horizon has little faunal activity, except occasionally
between the aggregates.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-12}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-12}}

A fragic horizon may underlie (but not necessarily directly) an
\emph{albic}, \emph{cambic}, \emph{spodic} or \emph{argic horizon},
unless the soil has been truncated. It can overlap partly or completely
with an \emph{argic horizon}, and if so, the fragic horizon may show
\emph{retic properties} or \emph{albeluvic glossae}. Many fragic
horizons have \emph{reducing conditions} and \emph{stagnic properties}.

Contrary to fragic horizons, \emph{plinthic horizons} will cement upon
repeated drying and wetting. Contrary to fragic horizons, many other
root-restricting horizons are cemented.

\hypertarget{gypsic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Gypsic horizon}\label{gypsic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-13}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-13}}

A gypsic horizon (from Greek \emph{gypsos}, gypsum) is a non-cemented
horizon containing accumulations of secondary gypsum
(CaSO\textsubscript{4}·2H\textsubscript{2}O) in various forms. It may be
a surface or a subsurface horizon.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-13}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-13}}

A gypsic horizon consists of \emph{mineral material} and:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  has ≥~5\% gypsum (related to the fine earth plus accumulations of
  secondary gypsum of any size and any cementation class);
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has one or both of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    meets the diagnostic criteria of \emph{protogypsic properties};
    \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    a gypsum content of ≥~5\% higher (absolute, related to the fine
    earth plus accumulations of secondary gypsum of any size and any
    cementation class) than that of an underlying layer and no
    \emph{lithic discontinuity} between the two layers;
    \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  has a product of thickness (in centimetres) times gypsum content
  (percentage, by mass) of ≥~150; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  does not form part of a \emph{petrogypsic horizon};
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has a thickness of ≥~15~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-9}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-9}}

How to recognize secondary gypsum is described in Annex~1 (Chapter
8.4.26). The accumulation may be in distinct form or flour-like. The
latter gives the gypsic horizon a massive structure.

Gypsum crystals may be visually mistaken for quartz. Gypsum is soft and
can easily be scratched with a knife or broken between thumbnail and
forefinger. Quartz is hard and cannot be broken except by hammering.

\hypertarget{additional-information-7}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-7}}

The recommended procedure to determine gypsum in the laboratory
(Annex~2, Chapter 9.10) also extracts anhydrite, which is considered to
be mainly primary.

Thin section analysis is helpful to establish the presence of secondary
gypsum, as individual gypsic pedofeatures or as generalized
accumulations in the groundmass.

If the accumulation of gypsum becomes such that all or most of the soil
structure and/or rock structure disappears and continuous concentrations
of gypsum prevail, the Hypergypsic qualifier is used.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-13}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-13}}

When gypsic horizons become continuously cemented, transition takes
place to the \emph{petrogypsic horizon}, the expression of which may be
as massive or platy structures. A gypsic horizon and a \emph{petrogypsic
horizon} may overlie each other. Accumulations of secondary gypsum, not
qualifying for a gypsic horizon, may fulfil the diagnostic criteria of
\emph{protogypsic properties}, which are fulfilled by most gypsic
horizons as well. \emph{Gypsiric material} includes primary gypsum.

In dry regions, gypsic horizons may be associated with \emph{calcic}
and/or \emph{salic horizons}. \emph{Calcic} and gypsic horizons usually
occupy distinct positions in the soil profile as the solubility of
calcium carbonate is less than that of gypsum. They can normally be
distinguished clearly from each other by the morphology (see
\emph{calcic horizon}). \emph{Salic} and gypsic horizons also occupy
different positions in the profile due to different solubilities.

\hypertarget{histic-horizon}{%

\hypertarget{general-description-14}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-14}}

A histic horizon (from Greek \emph{histos}, tissue) consists of poorly
aerated \emph{organic material}. It develops at the soil surface. In
places, it may be covered by \emph{mineral material}.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-14}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-14}}

A histic horizon consists of \emph{organic material} and:

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-14}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

Histic horizons have characteristics similar to the \emph{folic
horizon}. However, the \emph{folic horizon} is consecutively saturated
with water for less than thirty days in most years, which causes a
completely different vegetation and therefore a different character of
the \emph{organic material}. Histic horizons may show \emph{andic} or
\emph{vitric properties}.

\hypertarget{hortic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Hortic horizon}\label{hortic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-15}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-15}}

A hortic horizon (from Latin \emph{hortus}, garden) is a mineral surface
horizon created by the human activities of deep cultivation, intensive
fertilization and/or long-continued application of human and animal
wastes and other organic residues (e.g.~manures, kitchen refuse, compost
and night soil).

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-15}{%

A hortic horizon is a surface horizon consisting of \emph{mineral

\item
  a Munsell colour value and chroma of ≤~3, moist; \textbf{\emph{and}}

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-10}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-10}}

The hortic horizon is thoroughly mixed. Potsherds and other artefacts
are common, although often abraded. Tillage marks or evidence of mixing
of the soil can be present.

\hypertarget{additional-information-8}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-8}}

120~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1} P in the Mehlich-3 extract roughly
correspond to 43.6~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1} P or
100~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1} P\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{5} in
the Olsen extract (Kabała et al., 2018), which was the requirement in
former editions of WRB.

The hydragric horizon occurs below the plough pan of an \emph{anthraquic
horizon}. The features listed as part of diagnostic criterion 2 rarely
occur altogether in the same subhorizon but are commonly distributed
over several subhorizons. Major subhorizons have reductimorphic features
in pores with a Munsell colour hue of 2.5Y or yellower and a chroma of
≤~2, both moist, and/or concentrations of Fe and/or Mn oxides inside
soil aggregates as a result of oxidizing conditions. It usually shows
grey coatings on soil aggregate surfaces, consisting of clay, fine silt
and organic matter.

\hypertarget{additional-information-9}{%

Reduced manganese and/or iron move down slowly through the plough pan of
the overlying \emph{anthraquic horizon} into the hydragric horizon; the
mangenese tending to move further than the iron. Within the hydragric
horizon, manganese and iron migrate further into the interiors of the
soil aggregates where they are oxidized. In the lower part, subhorizons
may be influenced by groundwater.

A mollic horizon may easily be identified by its dark colour, caused by
the accumulation of organic matter, in most cases a well-developed
structure (usually a granular or subangular blocky structure), an
indication of high base saturation (e.g.~pH\textsubscript{water}
\textgreater~6), and its thickness.

The base saturation of ≥~50\% separates the mollic horizon from the
\emph{umbric horizon}, which is otherwise similar. The upper limit of
the content of soil organic carbon is 20\%, which is the lower limit for
\emph{organic material}.

A special type of mollic horizon is the \emph{chernic horizon}. It
requires a higher content of \emph{soil organic carbon}, a lower chroma,
a better developed soil structure, a minimum content of fine earth and a
greater minimum thickness.

Some \emph{hortic}, \emph{irragric}, \emph{pretic} or \emph{terric
horizons} may also qualify as mollic horizons.

  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-15}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-15}}

The colour of many natric horizons ranges from brown to black,
especially in the upper part, but lighter colours or yellow to red
colours may also be found. The structure is usually coarse columnar or
coarse prismatic, in places blocky. Rounded tops of the aggregates are
characteristic. In many cases, they are covered by a whitish powder
coming from the overlying eluvial horizon.

Both colour and structural characteristics depend on the composition of
the exchangeable cations and the soluble salt content in the underlying
layers. Often, thick and dark-coloured clay coatings occur, especially
in the upper part of the horizon. Many natric horizons have poor soil
aggregate stability and very low permeability under wet conditions. When
dry, the rupture-resistance class of the natric horizon is at least
hard. Soil reaction is commonly strongly alkaline with
pH\textsubscript{water} ≥~8.5.

\hypertarget{additional-information-10}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-10}}

Another measure to characterize the natric horizon is the sodium
adsorption ratio (SAR), which is ≥~13. The SAR is calculated from soil
solution data (Na\textsuperscript{+}, Ca\textsuperscript{2+},
Mg\textsuperscript{2+} given in mmol\textsubscript{c}/litre): SAR =
Na\textsuperscript{+}/{[}(Ca\textsuperscript{2+} +
Mg\textsuperscript{2+})/2{]}\textsuperscript{0.5}.

In micromorphological studies, natric horizons have a specific fabric.
The low structural stability is shown by a pore system with many
vesicles and vughs. Pedofeatures consist of layered silt and clay
cappings, coatings and infillings; clay intercalations and fragments of
clay coatings in the groundmass, due to partial structure collapse.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-20}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

The surface horizon may be rich in organic matter, have a thickness from
a few centimetres to \textgreater~25~cm and may be a \emph{mollic} or
\emph{chernic horizon}. An \emph{albic horizon} may be present between
the surface and the natric horizon.

Frequently, a salt-affected layer occurs below the natric horizon. The
salt influence may extend into the natric horizon, which then becomes
saline as well. Salts present may be chlorides, sulfates or
carbonates/bicarbonates.

The high ESP of the humus-illuvial part of the natric horizon separates
it from the \emph{sombric horizon}.

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-16}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-16}}

A nitic horizon has ≥~30\% clay but may feel loamy. Little difference in
clay content compared to the overlying and the underlying horizon and a
gradual or diffuse distinctness of the horizon boundaries are typical.
Similarly, there is no abrupt colour difference to the horizons directly
above and below. The colours are of low value with a hue often 2.5YR,
moist, but sometimes redder or yellower. The structure is moderate to
strong blocky, breaking into polyhedral or flat-edged elements showing
shiny pressure faces. In addition, clay coatings may be found. Nitic
horizons do not show reducing conditions but may show relict oximorphic
features, e.g., concretions and nodules of Fe and Mn oxides.

\hypertarget{additional-information-11}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-11}}

In many nitic horizons, the CEC (by 1~\emph{M}~NH\textsubscript{4}OAc,
pH~7) is \textless~36~cmol\textsubscript{c}~kg\textsuperscript{-1} clay,
or even \textless~24~cmol\textsubscript{c}~kg\textsuperscript{-1} clay.
The sum of exchangeable bases (by 1~\emph{M}~NH\textsubscript{4}OAc,
pH~7) plus exchangeable Al (by 1~\emph{M}~KCl, unbuffered) is about half
of the CEC. The moderate to low CEC reflects the dominance of 1:1 clay
minerals (either kaolinite and/or {[}meta-{]}halloysite). Many nitic
horizons have a ratio of water-dispersible clay to total clay of
\textless~0.1. Through the microscope, the birefringent fabric may be
striated. Clay coatings, if present, normally form fine coatings around
aggregates or may be incorporated into the matrix.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-21}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-21}}

The nitic horizon may be considered as a strongly expressed \emph{cambic
horizon} with specific properties such as a high amount of
oxalate-extractable (active) iron. Nitic horizons may show clay coatings
and may satisfy the requirements of an \emph{argic horizon}, although
the clay content in the nitic horizon is not much higher than in the
overlying horizon. Its mineralogy (kaolinitic/{[}meta{]}halloysitic)
sets it apart from most \emph{vertic horizons}, which have a dominantly
smectitic mineralogy and usually occur in climates with a more
pronounced dry season. However, nitic horizons may grade laterally into
\emph{vertic horizons} in lower landscape positions. The well-expressed
soil structure, the high amount of oxalate-extractable iron, and in some
cases, the intermediate CEC in nitic horizons set them apart from
\emph{ferralic horizons}. Nitic horizons strongly differ from
\emph{cohesic horizons}, which may also be rich in clay. Nitic horizons
in freely drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in humid tropical
and subtropical regions may occur in association with \emph{sombric
horizons}.

A panpaic horizon (from Quechua \emph{p'anpay}, to bury) is a buried
mineral surface horizon with a significant amount of organic matter
formed before having been buried. It is considered a diagnostic horizon,
although the process of burying is a geological process and not a

Some panpaic horizons also meet the criteria of the \emph{chernic},

A petrocalcic horizon (from Greek \emph{petros}, rock, and Latin

\hypertarget{field-identification-17}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-17}}

Petrocalcic horizons occur as non-platy calcrete (either massive or
nodular) or as platy calcrete, of which the following types are the most
common:

\emph{Lamellar calcrete}: superimposed, separate, petrified layers
varying in thickness from a few millimetres to several centimetres. The
colour is generally white or pink.

\emph{Petrified lamellar calcrete}: one or several extremely petrified
layers, grey or pink in colour. They are generally more cemented than
the lamellar calcrete and very massive (no fine lamellar structures, but
coarse lamellar structures may be present).

Non-capillary pores in petrocalcic horizons are filled, and the
hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow to very slow.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-23}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

In arid regions, petrocalcic horizons may occur in association with
(\emph{petro-})\emph{duric horizons}, into which they may grade
laterally. The cementing agent differentiates petrocalcic and
(\emph{petro}-)\emph{duric horizons}. In petrocalcic horizons, calcium
and some magnesium carbonate constitute the main cementing agent while
some accessory silica may be present. In (\emph{petro}-)\emph{duric
horizons}, silica is the main cementing agent, with or without calcium
carbonate. Petrocalcic horizons also occur in association with
\emph{gypsic} or \emph{petrogypsic horizons}. Horizons with a
significant accumulation of secondary carbonates without continuous
cementation qualify as \emph{calcic horizons}.

\hypertarget{field-identification-18}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-18}}

The identification of secondary silica is described in Annex 1 (Chapter
8.4.27). Effervescence after applying 1~\emph{M}~HCl may take place but
is mostly not as vigorous as in \emph{petrocalcic horizons}, which
appear similar. In very dry environments, the petroduric horizons
commonly are platy. In less dry environments, vertical fractures are
more common. It has usually a high penetration resistance.

\hypertarget{additional-information-12}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-12}}

If both silica and carbonates are present as cementing agents, the
petroduric horizon will only slake if hot concentrated KOH or NaOH (to
dissolve the silica) are alternated with HCl (to dissolve the
carbonates). If carbonates are absent, KOH or NaOH alone will be able to
slake the petroduric horizon.

Fragments of a petroduric horizon or durinodes constitute a \emph{duric

A petrogypsic horizon (from Greek petros, rock, and \emph{gypsos},

Petrogypsic horizons are cemented, whitish and composed predominantly of
gypsum. Old petrogypsic horizons may be capped by a thin, laminar layer
of newly precipitated gypsum. How to recognize secondary gypsum is
described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.26).

\hypertarget{additional-information-13}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-13}}

The recommended procedure to determine gypsum in the laboratory (Annex
2, Chapter 9.10) also extracts anhydrite, which is considered to be
mainly primary.

In thin sections, the petrogypsic horizon shows a a groundmass composed
of interlocked gypsum crystals with a hypidiotopic or xenotopic fabric,
mixed with varying amounts of detrital material.

As the petrogypsic horizon develops from a \emph{gypsic horizon}, the
two are closely related. Petrogypsic horizons frequently occur in
association with (\emph{petro}-)\emph{calcic horizons}. Accumulations of
calcium carbonate and gypsum usually occupy different positions in the
soil profile because the solubility of calcium carbonate is less than
that of gypsum. Normally, they can be distinguished clearly from each
other by their morphology (see \emph{calcic horizon}).

important cement and in which organic matter is either absent or present
only in traces. It has formed by continuous cementation of a
\emph{plinthic} or \emph{pisoplinthic horizon}. Advanced crystallization
of the oxides causes a very high penetration resistance. Traditional
names for horizons similar to the petroplinthic horizon are `laterite'
or `ironstone'.

Petroplinthic horizons are extremely hard (high penetration resistance)
and typically rusty brown to yellowish brown. They are either massive or
show an interconnected nodular pattern that encloses material with a
lower penetration resistance. They may be fractured. Roots are generally
found only in vertical fractures. Penetretation resistance is ≥~4.5~MPa
in ≥~50\% of the volume of the fine earth. From this value upwards, the
rupture resistance will not sink upon wetting (see Asiamah, 2000).

The ratio between Fe\textsubscript{ox} and Fe\textsubscript{dith} has

Petroplinthic horizons are closely associated with \emph{plinthic} and
\emph{pisoplinthic horizons} from which they develop. In some places,
\emph{plinthic horizons} can be traced by following petroplinthic layers
that have formed, for example, in road cuts.

The low ratio between Fe\textsubscript{ox} and Fe\textsubscript{dith}
separates the petroplinthic horizon from cemented \emph{spodic horizons}
(Ortsteinic or Placic qualifiers), which in addition contain mostly a
fair amount of organic matter. \emph{Limonic horizons} also have higher
ratios.

A pisoplinthic horizon (from Latin \emph{pisum}, pea, and Greek

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-27}{%

A pisoplinthic horizon results, when discrete concretions and/or nodules
of a \emph{plinthic horizon} reach a certain percentage and a
cementation class of at least moderately cemented. The cementation class
and the amount of concretions and/or nodules separate it from the
\emph{ferric horizon}. If the concretions and/or nodules are
sufficiently interconnected, the pisoplinthic horizon becomes a
\emph{petroplinthic horizon}. A pisoplinthic horizon may also be formed
by the fracturing of a \emph{petroplinthic horizon}.

\hypertarget{general-description-28}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-28}}

A plaggic horizon (from Low German \emph{plaggen}, sod) is a black or
brown mineral surface horizon that results from human activity. Mostly
in nutrient-poor soils in the north-western part of Central Europe from
Medieval times until the introduction of mineral fertilizers at the
beginning of the 20\textsuperscript{th} century, sod and other topsoil
materials were commonly used for bedding livestock. The sods consist of
grassy, herbaceous or dwarf-shrub vegetation, its root mats and organic
and mineral soil sticking to them. The mixture of sods and excrements
was later spread on fields. The material brought in eventually produced
an appreciably thickened horizon (in places \textgreater~100~cm thick)
that is rich in soil organic carbon. Base saturation is typically low.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-28}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-28}}

A plaggic horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material
and:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  has a texture class of sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or loam, or a
  combination of them; \textbf{\emph{and}}

  one or more of the following:

    layer or other evidence of former agricultural activity;
    \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}

\item
  has a base saturation (by 1~\emph{M}~NH\textsubscript{4}OAc, pH~7) of

\item

  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-21}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-21}}

The plaggic horizon has brownish or blackish colours, related to the
origin of source materials. It may contain \emph{artefacts}, but less
than 20\%. Its reaction is mostly slightly to strongly acid. The pH may
have risen due to recent liming but seldom reaching a high base
saturation. It may show evidence of old agricultural operations in its
lower part, such as spade or hook marks as well as old plough layers.
Plaggic horizons commonly overlie buried soils although the original
surface layers may be mixed with the plaggen. In some cases, ditches
have been made in the buried soil as a cultivation mode for soil
improvement. The lower boundary is typically clear to abrupt.

\hypertarget{additional-information-15}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-15}}

The texture class is in most cases sand or loamy sand. Sandy loam and
loam are rare. The soil organic carbon may include carbon added with the
plaggen. 100~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1} P in the Mehlich-3 extract (same
value as for pretic horizons) roughly correspond to
143~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1} P or 327~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1}
P\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{5} in 1\% citric acid (Kabała et al.,
2018). Originally, the plaggic horizon has a low base saturation. If
limed or fertilized, this criterion is waived.

After liming, some plaggic horizons may fulfil the criteria of the
\emph{terric horizon}, but \emph{terric horizons} usually have a higher
animal activity. Some plaggic horizons may contain black carbon and also
fulfil the criteria of the \emph{pretic horizon}. Some plaggic horizons
may also qualify as \emph{umbric} or even as \emph{mollic horizon}.

A plinthic horizon (from Greek \emph{plinthos}, brick) is a subsurface
horizon that is rich in Fe (in some cases also Mn) (hydr-)oxides and
poor in humus. The clay fraction is dominated by kaolinite, together
with other products of strong weathering, such as gibbsite. It may
contain quartz. The plinthic horizon has formed by redox processes,
usually caused by stagnant water, which may be active or relict, and
shows redoximorphic features. The plinthic horizon is not continuously
cemented. On exposure to repeated drying and wetting with free access to
oxygen, the oxides become more crystallized leading to a continuously
cemented horizon.

\hypertarget{field-identification-22}{%

A plinthic horizon shows prominent redoximorphic features. In a
perennially moist soil, many of the oximorphic features are non-cemented
or have a low cementation class and can be cut with a spade.

\hypertarget{additional-information-16}{%

Micromorphological studies may reveal the extent of impregnation of the
soil mass by Fe (hydr-)oxides. In many plinthic horizons, prolonged
\emph{reducing conditions} are not present anymore.

If the concretions and nodules of the plinthic horizon become at least

horizon becomes a \emph{pisoplinthic horizon}. If the plinthic horizon
becomes continuously cemented, the plinthic horizon becomes a
\emph{petroplinthic horizon}.

If the oximorphic features do not reach 15\% of the exposed area, it may
be a \emph{ferric horizon}.

\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-30}}

A pretic horizon (from Portuguese \emph{preto}, black) is a mineral
surface horizon that results from human activities with the addition of
black carbon, especially charcoal. It is characterized by its dark
colour, usually the presence of artefacts (ceramic fragments, lithic
instruments, bone or shell tools etc.) and high contents of organic
carbon, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium and micronutrients (mainly zinc
and manganese), usually contrasting with natural soils in the
surrounding area. It contains remnants of black carbon, which may be
recognized visually or by chemical analyses.

Pretic horizons are for example widespread in the Amazon Basin, where
they are the result of pre-Columbian activities and have persisted over
many centuries despite the prevailing humid tropical conditions
generally causing high organic matter mineralization rates. These soils
with a pretic horizon are known as `Terra Preta de Indio' or `Amazonian
Dark Earths'. They generally have high organic carbon stocks. Many of
them are dominated by low-activity clays.

Black carbon is an \emph{artefact} only if it is intentionally

P in the Mehlich-3 extract roughly is the double of the values obtained
in the Mehlich-1 extract (Kabała et al., 2018), which was the
requirement in the 3\textsuperscript{rd} edition of WRB. Additionally,
compared to the 3\textsuperscript{rd} edition, the value was increased

Halophytes (e.g.~some species of \emph{Salicornia}, \emph{Tamarix} and

Salt-affected layers are often puffy. Salts precipitate only after
evaporation of most soil moisture; if the soil is moist, salt may not be
visible.

Salts may precipitate at the soil surface (external Solonchaks) or at
depth (internal Solonchaks). A salt crust, if present, may be part of
the salic horizon.

A sombric horizon (from French \emph{sombre}, dark) is a dark-coloured

is neither associated with Al nor dispersed by Na.

\hypertarget{field-identification-25}{%

Sombric horizons are found in dark-coloured subsoils, in many cases
associated with well-drained soils of high plateaus and mountains in
humid tropical and subtropical regions. They resemble buried horizons
but, in contrast to many of these, sombric horizons more or less follow
the shape of the soil surface. They have a lower Munsell colour value
than the directly overlying horizon and commonly a low base saturation.

\hypertarget{additional-information-19}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-19}}

There are two important theories about the genesis of sombric horizons
(de Almeida et al., 2015).

First theory: The higher content of organic matter is illuvial, but
neither associated with Al nor with Na. In this case, coatings of
organic matter at soil aggregate surfaces and pore walls as well as
illuvial organic matter in thin sections are found.

Second theory: The higher content of organic matter is residual. A
moister climate and a higher plant biomass (e.g.~forest) formed thick A
horizons. Afterwards, climate became drier, the upper part of the old A
horizon underwent an intense mineralization, while the residues of the
current vegetation, poorer in biomass (e.g.~savanna), form only a thin A
horizon. At greater depth, mineralization is slower, and the lower part
of the old A horizon is preserved, especially if climate is cool and
base saturation low.

Sombric horizons may coincide with \emph{argic}, \emph{cambic},
\emph{ferralic} or \emph{nitic horizons}. Contrary to \emph{panpaic
horizons}, sombric horizons have no \emph{lithic discontinuity} at their
upper limit. \emph{Spodic horizons} are differentiated from sombric
horizons by their much higher CEC of the clay fraction. The
humus-illuvial part of \emph{natric horizons} has a higher clay content,
a high Na saturation and a specific structure, which separates them from
sombric horizons.

A spodic horizon (from Greek \emph{spodos}, wood ash) is a subsurface
horizon that contains illuvial substances. In most spodic horizons, the
appearance of the upper subhorizons is characterized by dark illuvial
organic matter and that of the lower subhorizons by intensely coloured
illuvial Fe oxides. Some spodic horizons, however, show either little
illuviation of Fe or little illuviation of organic matter. In all spodic
horizons, illuviated Al can be proven analytically. The illuvial
materials are characterized by a high pH-dependent charge, a relatively
large surface area and an elevated water retention. An overlying eluvial
horizon may intrude with tongues into the spodic horizon.

\hypertarget{field-identification-26}{%

Many spodic horizons underly \emph{claric material} and have
brownish-black to reddish-brown colours, which often fade downwards. The
shape of many spodic horizons is wavy, irregular, or broken. Spodic
horizons may be (partially) cemented. Thin and relatively continuous
cementations are indicated by the Placic qualifier and thicker and/or
less continuous cementations by the Ortsteinic qualifier. Spodic
horizons may extend further down in ribbon-like accumulations, which are
not included in the calculation of the minimum thickness.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-33}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-33}}

There may be a \emph{hortic}, \emph{plaggic}, \emph{terric} or
\emph{umbric horizon} above the spodic horizon, with or without
\emph{claric material} in between.

Spodic horizons in volcanic materials may exhibit \emph{andic
properties} as well. Spodic horizons in other materials may exhibit some
characteristics of the andic properties, but normally have a higher bulk
density. For classification purposes, the presence of a spodic horizon,
unless buried deeper than 50 cm, is given preference over the occurrence
of \emph{andic properties}.

Some layers with \emph{andic properties} resemble spodic horizons, if
they are covered by relatively young, lightcoloured volcanic ejecta that
satisfy the requirements of \emph{claric material}. There is a
\emph{lithic discontinuity} in between, which excludes them from being
spodic horizons. This can be further proven by the following analyses:
The uppermost 2.5~cm of the spodic horizon have a C\textsubscript{py}/OC
and a C\textsubscript{f}/C\textsubscript{py} of ≥~0.5.
C\textsubscript{py}, C\textsubscript{f} and OC are
pyrophosphate-extractable C, fulvic acid C and organic C, respectively
(Ito et al., 1991).

Similar to many spodic horizons, \emph{sombric horizons} also contain
more organic matter than an overlying layer. They can be differentiated
from each other by the clay mineralogy. Kaolinite usually dominates in
\emph{sombric horizons}, whereas the clay fraction of spodic horizons
commonly contains significant amounts of vermiculite and Al-interlayered
chlorite.

\emph{Plinthic horizons}, which contain large amounts of accumulated Fe,
have less Fe\textsubscript{ox} than spodic horizons.

\hypertarget{terric-horizon}{%
\subsection{Terric horizon}\label{terric-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-35}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-35}}

A terric horizon (from Latin \emph{terra}, earth) is a mineral surface
horizon that develops through addition of \emph{mineral material} or a
combination of \emph{mineral material} and organic residues, for
example, fertile mineral soil, compost, calcareous beach sands, loess or
mud. It may contain stones, randomly sorted and distributed. In most
cases, it is built up gradually over a long period of time.
Occasionally, terric horizons are created by single additions of
material. Normally the added material is mixed with the original
topsoil.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-35}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-35}}

A terric horizon is a surface horizon consisting of mineral material
and:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  shows evidence of addition of material substantially different from
  the environment, where it has been placed; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  contains, if any, \textless~10\% (by volume, related to the whole
  soil) artefacts; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has ≥~0.6\% soil organic carbon; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has a base saturation (by 1~\emph{M}~NH\textsubscript{4}OAc, pH~7) of
  ≥~50\%; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item

  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has a thickness of ≥~20~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-27}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-27}}

Terric horizons show characteristics related to the source material,
e.g.~in colour. Buried soils may be observed at the base of the horizon
although mixing can obscure the contact. Soils with a terric horizon
show a raised surface that may be inferred either from field observation
or from historical records. The terric horizon is not homogeneous, but
subhorizons are thoroughly mixed. It commonly contains a small amount of
\emph{artefacts} such as pottery fragments, cultural debris and refuse,
that are typically very small (\textless~1~cm in diameter) and very
abraded.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-34}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

Some terric horizons may also fulfil the criteria of anthropogenic
horizons with stronger alterations, like the \emph{hortic},
\emph{plaggic} or the \emph{pretic horizon}. Most \emph{hortic horizons}
show more and most \emph{plaggic horizons} less soil animal activity
than the terric horizon. The \emph{pretic horizons} contain black
carbon. Some terric horizons may qualify as \emph{mollic} horizon.

A thionic horizon (from Greek \emph{theion}, sulfur) is an extremely
acid subsurface horizon in which sulfuric acid is formed through
oxidation of sulfides.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-36}{%

A thionic horizon has:

  \item
    ≥~0.05\% water-soluble sulfate; \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  a thickness of ≥~15~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-28}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-28}}

Thionic horizons generally exhibit pale yellow jarosite or
yellowish-brown schwertmannite accumulations on or adjacent to surfaces
of soil aggregates. Soil reaction is extremely acid;
pH\textsubscript{water} of 3.5 is quite common. While mostly associated
with recent sulfidic coastal sediments, thionic horizons may also
develop inland in \emph{sulfidic materials} that may be present either
in natural deposits or in \emph{artefacts} such as mine spoil.

\hypertarget{additional-information-20}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-20}}

Iron or aluminium sulfate or hydroxysulfate minerals include jarosite,
natrojarosite, schwertmannite, sideronatrite and tamarugite. Thionic

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-35}{%

A thionic horizon often underlies a horizon with strongly expressed
\emph{stagnic properties}.

\hypertarget{tsitelic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Tsitelic horizon}\label{tsitelic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-37}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-37}}

A tsitelic horizon (from Georgian \emph{tsiteli}, red) shows a lateral
accumulation of Fe. It is usually found on lower slopes or in
depressions. Stagnosols and Planosols occur upslope in inclined
positions and have lost reduced Fe by lateral subsurface water flow.
Further down, the reduced Fe gets in contact with atmospheric oxygen, is
oxidized and accumulates in subsurface horizons starting usually at
shallow depths. They are rich in oxalate-extractable Fe, which gives the
tsitelic horizons a homogeneous reddish colour.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-37}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-37}}

A tsitelic horizon consists of \emph{mineral material} and

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  has a ratio between Fe\textsubscript{ox} and Fe\textsubscript{dith} of

\item
  has a thickness of ≥~5~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-29}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-29}}

The accumulation of ferrihydrites causes a homogeneous reddish colour
and, if the horizon is fine-textured, a low bulk density and some
thixotropy.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-36}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

Tsitelic horizons may resemble \emph{spodic horizons} of Rustic Podzols
but lack the translocation of Al that is required for \emph{spodic
horizons}. If showing low bulk density and thixotropy, they may give the
impression of \emph{andic properties}, but they have neither a
significant amount of allophanes and imogolites nor of Al-humus
complexes. Contrary to most horizons with \emph{andic properties},
tsitelic horizons show more Fe than Al in the oxalate extract. Layers
with oximorphic features caused by \emph{gleyic properties} may also
look similar to tsitelic horizons. While in layers with \emph{gleyic
properties}, the oxides are predominantly found at soil aggregate
surfaces, the oxides in tsitelic horizons fill the entire soil matrix
homogenously. Tsitelic horizons distinguish well from \emph{limonic
horizons}, which are (at least partially) cemented.

\hypertarget{umbric-horizon}{%
\subsection{Umbric horizon}\label{umbric-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-38}{%

An umbric horizon (from Latin \emph{umbra}, shade) is a relatively
thick, dark-coloured surface horizon with a low base saturation and a
moderate to high content of organic matter.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-38}{%

An umbric horizon is a surface horizon consisting of \emph{mineral

  single or in combination, in ≥~50\% (by volume):

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}

    \item

    \item
      ≥~2.5\% soil organic carbon;
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  if a layer is present that corresponds to the parent material of the
  umbric horizon and that has a Munsell colour value of ≤~4, moist,
  ≥~0.6\% (absolute) more \emph{soil organic carbon} than this layer;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  a base saturation (by 1~\emph{M}~NH\textsubscript{4}OAc, pH~7) of
  \textless~50\% on a weighted average; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  a thickness of one of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}

  \item
    ≥~20~cm.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-30}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-30}}

The main field characteristics of an umbric horizon are its dark colour
and its structure. In general, umbric horizons tend to have a lesser
grade of soil structure than \emph{mollic horizons}.

Most umbric horizons have an acid reaction (pH\textsubscript{water}
\textless~5.5), which usually indicates a base saturation of
\textless~50\%. An additional indication for strong acidity is a
shallow, horizontal rooting pattern in the absence of a physical
barrier.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-37}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-37}}

The base saturation requirement sets the umbric horizon apart from the
\emph{mollic horizon}, which is otherwise similar. The upper limit of
the content of \emph{soil organic carbon} is 20\%, which is the lower
limit for \emph{organic material}.

Some \emph{irragric} and \emph{plaggic horizons} may also qualify as
umbric horizons.

\hypertarget{vertic-horizon}{%
\subsection{Vertic horizon}\label{vertic-horizon}}

\hypertarget{general-description-39}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-39}}

A vertic horizon (from Latin \emph{vertere}, to turn) is a clay-rich
subsurface horizon that, as a result of shrinking and swelling, has
slickensides and wedge-shaped soil aggregates.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-39}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-39}}

A vertic horizon consists of mineral material and has:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

  ≥~30\% clay; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  one or both of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a. in ≥~20\% (by volume), wedge-shaped soil aggregates with a

    slickensides on ≥~10\% of the surfaces of soil aggregates;
    \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  \emph{shrink-swell cracks}; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  a thickness of ≥~25~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-31}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-31}}

Vertic horizons are clay-rich and, when dry, often have a
rupture-resistance class of at least hard. Polished, shiny surfaces with
striations (slickensides), often at sharp angles, are distinctive.

Wedge-shaped soil aggregates and slickensides (see Annex 1, Chapter
8.4.10 and 8.4.14) may not be immediately evident if the soil is moist.
A decision about their presence can sometimes only be made after the
soil has dried out. Wedge-shaped aggregates may be a second-level
structure of larger angular blocky or prismatic elements, which should
be carefully examined to see if wedge-shaped aggregates are present.

\hypertarget{additional-information-21}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-21}}

The coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE, see Annex 2, Chapter 9.6)
is usually ≥~0.06.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-38}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

Several other diagnostic horizons may also have high clay contents,
e.g., the \emph{argic}, \emph{natric} and \emph{nitic horizon}. Most of
them lack the characteristics typical for the vertic horizon. However,
they may be laterally linked in the landscape with vertic horizons, the
latter usually taking up the lowest position. Less pronounced swelling
and shrinking of clay minerals leads to a \emph{protovertic horizon}.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-properties}{%
\section{Diagnostic properties}\label{diagnostic-properties}}

\textbf{Diagnostic properties} are characterized by a combination of
attributes that reflect results of soil-forming processes or indicate
specific conditions of soil formation. Their features can be observed or
measured in the field or the laboratory and require a minimum or maximum
expression to qualify as diagnostic. A minimum thickness is not part of
the criteria.

\hypertarget{general-description-40}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-40}}

An abrupt textural difference (from Latin \emph{abruptus}, broken away)
is a very sharp increase in clay content within a limited depth range.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-40}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-40}}

An abrupt textural difference refers to two superimposed layers
consisting of \emph{mineral material} with all of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  the underlying layer has all of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}

  \item
    ≥~ 15\% clay; \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \item
    a thickness of ≥~7.5~cm; \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  the underlying layer starts ≥~10~cm from the mineral soil surface;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  the underlying layer has, compared to the overlying layer:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    at least twice as much clay if the overlying layer has
    \textless~20\% clay; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    ≥~20\% (absolute) more clay if the overlying layer has ≥~20\% clay;
    \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  if the limit between the two layers is not even, the depth of the
  abrupt textural difference is, where the underlying layer reaches
  ≥~50\% of the total volume; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  a transitional layer, if present, has a thickness of ≤~2~cm.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{additional-information-22}{%
\subsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-22}}

An example for an uneven limit between the two layers are \emph{retic
properties} in the underlying layer. Depending on the development of the
\emph{retic properties}, the abrupt textural difference may be at the
upper limit of the \emph{retic properties} or further down (criterion
3).

The term albeluvic glossae (from Latin \emph{albus}, white, and
\emph{eluere}, to wash out, and Greek \emph{glossa}, tongue) refers to
penetrations of clay- and Fe-depleted material into an \emph{argic

vertically continuous tongues. In horizontal sections, they exhibit a

\item
  show \emph{retic properties} in the \emph{argic horizon};
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  have continuous tongues consisting of coarser-textured material, as

  of the \emph{argic horizon}, with all of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii})}
  \tightlist
  \item

\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-39}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

Albeluvic glossae are a special case of \emph{retic properties}. In
\emph{retic properties}, the coarser-textured parts may be thinner and
are not necessarily vertically continuous. \emph{Retic properties} may
also be present in \emph{natric horizons} whereas albeluvic glossae are
defined only in \emph{argic horizons}. The \emph{argic horizon} into
which the albeluvic glossae penetrate may also fulfil the diagnostic
criteria of a \emph{fragic horizon}. In undisturbed soils, the
\emph{argic horizon} with the albeluvic glossae is typically overlain by
an \emph{albic} or \emph{cambic horizon}. However, the overlying
horizons may be lost due to erosion or ploughing.

\hypertarget{andic-properties}{%
\subsection{Andic properties}\label{andic-properties}}

\hypertarget{general-description-42}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-42}}

Andic properties (from Japanese \emph{an}, dark, and \emph{do}, soil)
result from moderate weathering of mainly pyroclastic deposits. The
presence of short-range-order minerals and/or organo-metallic complexes
is characteristic for andic properties. These minerals and complexes are
commonly part of the weathering sequence in pyroclastic deposits
(\emph{tephric material} → \emph{vitric properties} → andic properties).
However, andic properties with organo-metallic complexes may also form
in non-pyroclastic silicate-rich materials in cooltemperate and humid
climates.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-42}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-42}}

Andic properties require:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  a bulk density of ≤~0.9~kg~dm\textsuperscript{-3}; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  an Al\textsubscript{ox} + ½Fe\textsubscript{ox} value of ≥~2\%;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  a phosphate retention of ≥~85\%.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-32}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-32}}

Andic properties may be identified using the sodium fluoride field test
of Fieldes and Perrott (1966). A pH in NaF of ≥~9.5 indicates allophane
and/or organo-aluminium complexes in carbonate-free soils. The test is
indicative for most layers with andic properties, except for those very
rich in organic matter. However, the same reaction occurs in
\emph{spodic horizons} and in certain acid clays that are rich in
Al-interlayered clay minerals.

Andic layers may exhibit thixotropy, i.e.~the soil material changes,
under pressure or by rubbing, from a plastic solid into a liquefied
stage and back into the solid condition.

\hypertarget{additional-information-23}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-23}}

Andic properties may be found at the soil surface or in the subsurface,
commonly occurring as layers. Many surface layers with andic properties
contain a high amount of organic matter (≥~5\%), are commonly very dark
coloured (Munsell colour value and chroma of ≤~3, moist), have a fluffy
macrostructure, and in some places show thixotropy. They have a low bulk
density and commonly have a silt loam or finer texture. Andic surface
layers rich in organic matter may be very thick, having a thickness of
≥~50~cm in some soils. Andic subsurface layers are generally somewhat
lighter coloured.

In perhumid climates, humus-rich andic layers may contain more than
twice the water content of samples that have been dried at 105~°C and
rewetted (hydric characteristic).

For bulk density, the volume is determined after an undried soil sample
has been desorbed at 33~kPa (no prior drying), and afterwards the weight
is determined at 105~°C.

Two major types of andic properties are recognized: one in which
allophane, imogolite and similar minerals are predominant (Silandic
qualifier); and one in which Al complexed by organic acids prevails
(Aluandic qualifier). The silandic property typically gives a strongly
acid to neutral soil reaction and is a bit lighter coloured, while the
aluandic property gives an extremely acid to acid reaction and a
blackish colour.

Uncultivated, organic matter-rich surface layers with silandic
properties typically have a pHwater of ≥~4.5, while uncultivated surface
layers with aluandic properties and rich in organic matter typically
have a pH\textsubscript{water} of \textless~4.5. Generally,
pH\textsubscript{water} in silandic subsoil layers is ≥~5.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-40}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-40}}

\emph{Vitric properties} are distinguished from andic properties by a
lesser degree of weathering. This is evidenced by the presence of
volcanic glasses and usually by a lower amount of short-range-order
pedogenic minerals and/or organo-metallic complexes, as characterized by
a lower amount of Al\textsubscript{ox} and Fe\textsubscript{ox}, a
higher bulk density, or a lower phosphate retention. The diagnostic
criteria of the \emph{vitric} and \emph{andic properties} are adapted
after Shoji et al.~(1996), Takahashi et al.~(2004) and findings of the
COST 622 Action.

\emph{Spodic horizons}, which also contain complexes of oxides and
organic substances, can exhibit andic properties as well. Andic
properties may also be present in \emph{chernic}, \emph{mollic} or
\emph{umbric horizons}.

\subsection{Anthric properties}\label{anthric-properties}}

\hypertarget{general-description-43}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-43}}

Anthric properties (from Greek \emph{anthropos}, human being) refer to
human-made \emph{mollic} or \emph{umbric horizons}. Some of the
\emph{mollic horizons} with anthric properties are natural \emph{umbric
horizons} transformed into \emph{mollic horizons} by liming and
fertilization. Thin, light-coloured or humus-poor mineral topsoil
horizons may be transformed into \emph{umbric} or even \emph{mollic
horizons} by long-term cultivation (ploughing, liming, fertilization
etc.). Another group of artificial \emph{mollic} or \emph{umbric
horizons} is created by ploughing organic surface layers into the
mineral soil. In all these cases, the soil has very little animal
activity, which is especially uncommon for soils with a \emph{mollic
horizon}.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-43}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-43}}

Anthric properties:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  occur in soils with a \emph{mollic} or \emph{umbric horizon};
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  show evidence of human disturbance by one or more of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    an abrupt lower boundary at ploughing depth and ≥~10\% of the sand
    grains not coated by organic matter; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    an abrupt lower boundary at ploughing depth and evidence of mixing
    of humus-richer and humus-poorer soil materials by ploughing;
    \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    lumps of applied lime; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    ≥~430~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1} P in the Mehlich-3 extract in the
    upper 20~cm; \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  show \textless~5\% (by exposed area) of animal pores, coprolites or
  other traces of soil animal activity in one or both of the following
  depths:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    in the lowermost 5~cm of the \emph{mollic} or \emph{umbric horizon};
    \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    in a depth range of 5~cm below the plough layer, if present.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-33}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-33}}

Signs of mixing or cultivation, evidence of liming (e.g.~remnants of
applied lime chunks), the dark colour and the almost complete absence of
traces of soil animal activity are the main criteria for recognition.
Incorporated humus-richer material may be established with the naked
eye, using a 10x hand lens or using thin sections, depending on the
degree of fragmentation/dispersion of the humus-richer material. The
incorporated humus-richer material is typically weakly bound to the
humus-poorer material, which is manifested by uncoated sand grains in a
darker matrix throughout the mixed layer.

\hypertarget{additional-information-24}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-24}}

430~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1} P in the Mehlich-3 extract roughly
correspond to 654~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1} P or
1500~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1} P\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{5} in
1\% citric acid (Kabała et al., 2018), which was the requirement in
former editions of WRB. The original idea of the anthric properties is
derived from Krogh \& Greve (1999).

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-41}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other

Anthric properties are an additional characteristic of some
\emph{mollic} or \emph{umbric horizons}. \emph{Chernic horizons}
normally show a higher animal activity and do not have anthric
properties.

\subsection{Continuous rock}\label{continuous-rock}}

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-44}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-44}}

Continuous rock (from Latin \emph{continuare}, to continue) is
consolidated material, exclusive of cemented pedogenic horizons such as
\emph{limonic}, \emph{petrocalcic}, \emph{petroduric},
\emph{petrogypsic}, \emph{petroplinthic} and \emph{spodic horizons}.
Continuous rock is sufficiently consolidated to remain intact when an
air-dried specimen, 25--30~mm on one side, is submerged in water for
1~hour. The material is considered continuous only if cracks occupy
\textless~10\% (by volume) of the continuous rock, with no significant
displacement of the rock having taken place.

\hypertarget{gleyic-properties}{%
\subsection{Gleyic properties}\label{gleyic-properties}}

\hypertarget{general-description-44}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-44}}

Gleyic properties (from Russian folk name \emph{gley}, wet bluish clay)
develop in layers that are saturated with groundwater (or were saturated
in the past, if now drained) for a period that allows \emph{reducing
conditions} to occur (this may range from a few days in the tropics to a
few weeks in other areas) and in the capillary fringe above them. There
may be gleyic properties without the presence of groundwater in a
clay-rich layer over a layer rich in sand or coarse fragments. In some
soils with gleyic properties, the \emph{reducing conditions} are caused
by upward moving gases such as methane or carbon dioxide. If there are
no more \emph{reducing conditions}, the gleyic properties are relict.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-45}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-45}}

Gleyic properties refer to \emph{mineral material}, show redoximorphic
features and comprise one of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  a layer with ≥~95\% (by exposed area) reductimorphic features that
  have the following Munsell colours, moist:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    a hue of N, 10Y, GY, G, BG, B or PB; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y and a chroma of ≤~2; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  a layer with \textgreater~5\% (by exposed area) oximorphic features
  that:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    are predominantly on biopore walls and, if soil aggregates are
    present, predominantly on or adjacent to aggregate surfaces;
    \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \item
    have a Munsell colour hue ≥~2.5 units redder and a chroma ≥~1 unit
    higher, moist, than the surrounding material or than the matrix of
    the directly underlying layer; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  a combination of two layers: a layer fulfilling diagnostic criterion 2
  and a directly underlying layer fulfilling diagnostic criterion 1.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-34}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-34}}

Redoximorphic features are described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.20).

\hypertarget{additional-information-25}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-25}}

Gleyic properties result from a redox gradient between groundwater and
the capillary fringe causing an uneven distribution of iron or manganese
(hydr-)oxides. In the lower part of the soil and/or inside the soil
aggregates, the oxides are either transformed into soluble Fe/Mn(II)
compounds or they are translocated; both processes lead to the absence
of colours that have a Munsell hue redder than 2.5Y. Translocated Fe and
Mn compounds can be concentrated in the oxidized form (Fe{[}III{]},
Mn{[}IV{]}) on soil aggregate surfaces or on biopore walls (rusty root
channels), and towards the surface even in the matrix. Mn concentrations
can be recognized by strong effervescence using a
10\%~H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} solution.

Reductimorphic features reflect permanently wet conditions. In loamy and
clayey material, blue-green colours predominate owing to Fe(II, III)
hydroxy salts (green rust). If the material is rich in sulfur (S),
blackish colours prevail owing to colloidal iron sulfides such as
greigite or mackinawite (easily recognized by smell, after applying
1~\emph{M}~HCl). In calcareous material, whitish colours are dominant
owing to calcite and/or siderite. Sands are usually light grey to white
in colour and also often impoverished in Fe and Mn. Bluish-green and
black colours are unstable and often oxidize to a reddish brown colour
within a few hours of exposure to air. The upper part of a
reductimorphic layer may show up to 5\% rusty colours, mainly around
channels of burrowing animals or plant roots.

Oximorphic features reflect oxidizing conditions, as in the capillary
fringe and in the surface horizons of soils with fluctuating groundwater
levels. Specific colours indicate ferrihydrite (reddish brown), goethite
(bright yellowish brown), lepidocrocite (orange), schwertmannite (dark
orange) and jarosite (pale yellow). In loamy and clayey soils, the iron
oxides/hydroxides are concentrated on soil aggregate surfaces and the
walls of larger pores (e.g.~old root channels).

In most cases, a layer fulfilling diagnostic criterion 2 overlies a
layer fulfilling criterion 1. Some soils, including underwater soils
(freshwater or seawater) and tidal soils have only a layer that fulfils
diagnostic criterion 1 and no layer fulfilling criterion 2.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-42}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-42}}

Gleyic properties differ from \emph{stagnic properties}. Gleyic
properties are caused by an upward moving agent (mostly groundwater)
that causes \emph{reducing conditions} and that leads to an underlying
strongly reduced layer and an overlying layer with oximorphic features
on or adjacent to soil aggregate surfaces. (In some soils only one of
these layers is present.) \emph{Stagnic properties} are caused by
stagnation of an intruding agent (mostly rainwater) that causes
\emph{reducing conditions} and that leads to an overlying Fe-poor layer
and an underlying layer with oximorphic features inside the soil
aggregates. (In some soils, only one of these layers is present.)

\hypertarget{lithic-discontinuity}{%
\subsection{Lithic discontinuity}\label{lithic-discontinuity}}

\hypertarget{general-description-45}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-45}}

Lithic discontinuities (from Greek \emph{lithos}, stone, and Latin
\emph{continuare}, to continue) represent significant differences in
parent material within a soil. A lithic discontinuity can also denote
different times of deposition. The different strata may have the same or
a different mineralogy.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-46}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-46}}

When comparing two directly superimposed layers consisting of mineral

      ≥~25\% in the ratio sand to silt, \textbf{\emph{and}} a difference
      of ≥~5\% (absolute) in the content of sand and/or silt;
      \textbf{\emph{and}}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    the differences do not result from original variation within the
    parent material in the form of patches of different particle-size
    fractions within a layer; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  the layers have coarse fragments with different lithology;
  \textbf{\emph{or}}
\item
  a layer containing coarse fragments without weathering rinds overlying
  a layer containing coarse fragments with weathering rinds;
  \textbf{\emph{or}}
\item

\item
  an overlying layer that has ≥~10\% (absolute, by volume, related to
  the whole soil) more coarse fragments than the underlying layer,
  unless the difference is created by animal activity;
  \textbf{\emph{or}}
\item
  a lower amount of coarse fragments in the overlying layer that cannot
  be explained by advanced weathering in the overlying layer;
  \textbf{\emph{or}}
\item
  abrupt differences in colour not resulting from soil formation;
  \textbf{\emph{or}}
\item
  marked differences in size and shape of resistant minerals (as shown
  by micromorphological or mineralogical methods); \textbf{\emph{or}}
\item
  differences in the TiO\textsubscript{2}/ZrO\textsubscript{2} ratios of
  the sand fraction by a factor of ≥~2; \textbf{\emph{or}}
\item
  differences in CEC (by 1~\emph{M}~NH\textsubscript{4}OAc, pH~7) per kg
  clay by a factor of ≥~2.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{additional-information-26}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-26}}

In some cases, a lithic discontinuity may be suggested by one of the
following: a horizontal line of coarse fragments (stone line) overlying
and underlying layers with lesser amounts of coarse fragments, or a
decreasing percentage of coarse fragments with increasing depth. On the
other hand, the sorting action of small fauna such as termites can
produce similar effects in what would initially have been lithicly
uniform parent material.

Diagnostic criterion 2 is illustrated by the following example:

Layer 1: 20\% coarse sand, 10\% medium sand → ratio coarse sand to
medium sand: 2.\\
Layer 2: 15\% coarse sand, 10\% medium sand → ratio coarse sand to
medium sand: 1.5. Difference in ratios: 25\%\\
Difference in contents of coarse sand (absolute): 5\%\\
Difference in contents of medium sand (absolute): 0\\
Result: between the two layers, there is a lithic discontinuity.

Generally, the mathematical formula for calculating differences in
ratios is:\\
ABS(ratio\textsubscript{i}-ratio\textsubscript{i+1})/MAX(ratio\textsubscript{i};
ratio\textsubscript{i+1})*100

Protocalcic properties (from Greek \emph{proton}, first, and Latin

solution and precipitated in the soil. They do not belong to the soil
parent material or to other sources such as dust. They occur across the

Retic properties (from Latin \emph{rete}, net) describe the
interfingering of coarser-textured \emph{claric material} into a
finer-textured \emph{argic} or \emph{natric horizon}. The interfingering
coarser-textured \emph{claric material} is characterized by a partial

\hypertarget{field-identification-37}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-37}}

Redoximorphic features are described in Annex 1 (Chapter 8.4.20).

\hypertarget{additional-information-28}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-28}}

Stagnic properties result from a reduction of iron and/or manganese
(hydr-)oxides around the larger pores. Mobilized Mn and Fe may be washed
out laterally resulting in \emph{claric material} (especially in the
upper part of the profile that is coarser textured in many soils) or may
migrate into the interiors of the soil aggregates where they are
reoxidized (especially in the lower part of the profile).

If the stagnic properties are weakly expressed, the reductimorphic and
oximorphic features cover only some parts of the exposed area, and the
other parts show the original matrix colour that prevailed in the soil
before the redox processes started. If the stagnic properties are
strongly expressed, the entire exposed area of the fine earth shows
either reductimorphic or oximorphic features.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-48}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-48}}

Stagnic properties differ from \emph{gleyic properties}. Stagnic
properties are caused by stagnation of an intruding agent (mostly
rainwater) that causes \emph{reducing conditions} and that leads to an
overlying Fe-poor layer and an underlying layer with oximorphic features
inside the soil aggregates. (In some soils, only one of these layers is
present.) \emph{Gleyic properties} are caused by an upward moving agent
(mostly groundwater) that causes \emph{reducing conditions} and that
leads to an underlying strongly reduced layer and an overlying layer
with oximorphic features on or adjacent to the soil aggregate surfaces.
(In some soils, only one of these layers is present.)

\hypertarget{general-description-52}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-52}}

Takyric properties (from Turkic languages \emph{takyr}, barren land) are
related to a fine-textured surface crust with a platy or massive
structure. They occur under arid conditions in periodically flooded
soils.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-54}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-54}}

Takyric properties refer to a surface crust consisting of \emph{mineral
material} that has all of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  a texture class of clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  a platy or massive structure; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  polygonal cracks, ≥~2~cm deep and with an average horizontal spacing
  of ≤~20~cm, when the soil is dry; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  a rupture-resistance class of at least hard when dry and a plasticity
  of at least moderately plastic when moist; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  an electrical conductivity (EC\textsubscript{e}) of the saturation
  extract of

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textless~4~dS~m\textsuperscript{-1}; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    at least 1~dS~m\textsuperscript{-1} less than that of the layer
    directly below the surface crust.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-38}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-38}}

Takyric properties occur in depressions in arid regions, where surface
water, rich in clay and silt but relatively low in soluble salts,
accumulates and leaches salts out of the upper soil horizons. This
causes clay dispersion and the formation of a thick, compact,
fine-textured crust with prominent polygonal cracks when dry. The crust
often contains ≥~80\% clay and silt. It is thick enough that it does not
curl entirely upon drying.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-49}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-49}}

Takyric properties occur in association with many diagnostic horizons,
the most important ones being the \emph{natric}, \emph{salic},
\emph{gypsic}, \emph{calcic} and \emph{cambic horizons}. The low EC and
low soluble-salt content of takyric properties set them apart from the
\emph{salic horizon}.

\hypertarget{vitric-properties}{%
\subsection{Vitric properties}\label{vitric-properties}}

\hypertarget{general-description-53}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-53}}

Vitric properties (from Latin \emph{vitrum}, glass) apply to layers that
contain glass from volcanic or industrial origin and that contain a
limited amount of short-range-order minerals or organo-metallic
complexes.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-55}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-55}}

Vitric properties require:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  in the fraction between \textgreater~0.02 and ≤~2~mm, ≥~5\% (by grain
  count) volcanic glass, glassy aggregates, other glass-coated primary
  minerals or glasses resulting from industrial processes;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  an Al\textsubscript{ox} + ½Fe\textsubscript{ox} value of ≥~0.4\%;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  a phosphate retention of ≥~25\%.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-39}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-39}}

Vitric properties can occur in a surface layer. However, they can also
occur under some tens of centimetres of recent pyroclastic deposits.
Layers with vitric properties can have an appreciable amount of organic
matter. The sand and coarse silt fractions of layers with vitric
properties have a significant amount of unaltered or partially altered
volcanic glass, glassy aggregates, other glass-coated primary minerals
or glassses resulting from industiral processes (coarser fractions may
be checked by using a 10x hand lens; finer fractions may be checked by
using a microscope).

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-50}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-50}}

Vitric properties are, on the one hand, closely linked with \emph{andic
properties}, into which they may eventually develop. For some time
during this development, a layer may show both the amount of volcanic
glasses required for the vitric properties and the characteristics of
\emph{andic properties}. On the other hand, layers with vitric
properties develop from \emph{tephric material}. The diagnostic criteria
of the vitric and \emph{andic properties} are adapted after Shoji et
al.~(1996), Takahashi et al.~(2004) and findings of the COST 622 Action.

\emph{Chernic}, \emph{mollic} and \emph{umbric horizons} may exhibit
vitric properties as well.

\hypertarget{yermic-properties}{%
\subsection{Yermic properties}\label{yermic-properties}}

\hypertarget{general-description-54}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-54}}

Yermic properties (from Spanish \emph{yermo}, desert) are found on the
mineral soil surface in deserts. They comprise features like desert
pavement, desert varnish, ventifacts (windkanters), a platy strucure and
vesicular pores.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-56}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-56}}

Yermic properties occur in \emph{mineral material} and have one or both
of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  coarse surface fragments covering ≥~20\% of the soil surface (desert
  pavement), underlain by a soil layer with an abundance of coarse
  fragments half or less the abundance of coarse surface fragments, and
  one or more of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ≥~10\% of the coarse fragments, \textgreater~2~cm (greatest
    dimension), are varnished; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    ≥~10\% of the coarse fragments, \textgreater~2~cm (greatest
    dimension), are wind-shaped (ventifacts, windkanters);
    \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    a surface layer, ≥~1~cm thick, with a platy structure;
    \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    a surface layer, ≥~1~cm thick, with many vesicular pores;
    \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  a surface layer, not compacted by human activity, ≥~1~cm thick, with a
  platy structure and many vesicular pores.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-40}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-40}}

The features of the yermic properties are described in Annex 1:\\
desert pavement (Chapter 8.3.4)\\
desert varnish and ventifacts (Chapter 8.3.5)\\
platy structure (Chapter 8.4.10)\\
vesicular pores (Chapter 8.4.12) - to be diagnostic, the vesicular pores
must be present in the abundance class `many'.

If the texture is fine enough, the soil may show a polygonal network of
desiccation cracks (Chapter 8.4.13), often filled with in-blown
material, that extend into greater depths. In cold deserts, larger
coarse fragments at the soil surface are often shattered by frost.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-51}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-51}}

Yermic properties often occur in association with other diagnostics,
characteristic for desert environments (\emph{salic}, \emph{duric},
\emph{gypsic}, \emph{calcic} and \emph{cambic horizons}). In very cold
deserts (e.g.~Antarctica), they may occur associated with \emph{cryic
horizons}. Under these conditions, coarse cryoclastic material
dominates, and there is little dust to be deflated and deposited by
wind. Here, a dense pavement with varnish, ventifacts, aeolian sand
layers and accumulations of soluble minerals may occur directly on loose
deposits, without vesicular pores.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-materials}{%
\section{Diagnostic materials}\label{diagnostic-materials}}

\textbf{Diagnostic materials} are materials that significantly influence
soil-forming processes. Their characteristics may be inherited from the
parent material or may be the result of soil-forming processes.
Diagnostic materials do not describe parent material; they describe soil
material, and the characteristics refer (as for all diagnostics) to the
fine earth, unless stated otherwise. Their features can be observed or
measured in the field or the laboratory and require a minimum or maximum
expression to qualify as diagnostic. A minimum thickness is not part of
the criteria.

Artefacts describe human-made, human-altered and human-excavated

chemically and mineralogically not or only poorly altered and still
largely recognizable.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-58}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-58}}

Artefacts (from Latin \emph{ars}, art, and \emph{factus}, made) are
liquid or solid substances of any size that:

\emph{Technic hard material} and geomembranes, intact, fractured or

\hypertarget{calcaric-material}{%
\subsection{Calcaric material}\label{calcaric-material}}

\hypertarget{general-description-57}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-57}}

Calcaric material (from Latin \emph{calcarius}, containing lime) refers
to material that contains ≥~2\% calcium carbonate equivalent. The
carbonates are at least partially inherited from the parent material
(primary carbonates).

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-59}{%

Calcaric material shows visible effervescence with 1~\emph{M}~HCl
throughout the fine earth.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-53}{%

Calcaric material may also meet the diagnostic criteria of
\emph{protocalcic properties}, which show discernible accumulations of
secondary carbonates. \emph{Calcic} and \emph{petrocalcic horizons} have
higher contents of carbonates and also show secondary carbonates.
\emph{Petrocalcic horizons} are continuously cemented.

Claric material (from Latin \emph{clarus}, bright) is light-coloured
fine earth.

    \item
      ≥~25\% of the sand and coarse silt grains are uncoated.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-41}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-41}}

Identification in the field depends on soil colours. In addition, a 10x
hand lens may be used to ascertain that sand and coarse silt grains are
free of coatings (criterion 2.d). Claric material may exhibit a
considerable shift in chroma when wetted.

\hypertarget{additional-information-30}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-30}}

The presence of coatings around sand and coarse silt grains can be
determined using an optical microscope for analysing thin sections.
Uncoated grains usually show a very thin rim at their surface. Coatings
may be of an organic nature, consist of iron oxides, or both, and are
dark-coloured under translucent light. Iron coatings become reddish in
colour under reflected light, while organic coatings remain
brownish-black.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-54}{%

The claric material is used as a diagnostic criterion in the definition
of the \emph{spodic horizon}, the \emph{retic} and the \emph{stagnic

Hypersulfidic material (from Greek \emph{hyper}, over, and Latin

\item
  when a layer, 2--10~mm thick, is incubated aerobically at field

Hypersulfidic material is seasonally or permanently waterlogged or forms
under largely anaerobic conditions. It has a Munsell colour hue of N,
5Y, 5GY, 5BG, or 5G, a value of ≤~4, and a chroma of 1, all moist. If
the soil is disturbed, an odour of hydrogen sulfide (rotten eggs) may be
noticed. This is accentuated by application of 1~\emph{M}~HCl.

For a quick screening test that is not definitive, a 10~g sample treated
with 50~ml of 30\% H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} will show a fall
in pH to ≤~2.5. Final assessment depends on incubation testing.

\textbf{Caution}: H\textsubscript{2}O\textsubscript{2} is a strong
oxidant, and sulfides and organic matter will froth violently in a test
tube that may become very hot.

Hyposulfidic material (from Greek \emph{hypo}, under, and Latin
\emph{sulpur}, sulfur) contains inorganic sulfidic S and is not capable
of severe acidification resulting from the oxidation of inorganic
sulfidic compounds contained within it. Although oxidation does not lead
to the formation of acid sulfate soils, hyposulfidic material is an
important environmental hazard due to processes related to inorganic
sulfides. Hyposulfidic material has a self-neutralizing capacity,
usually due to the presence of calcium carbonate.

Hyposulfidic material:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  as ≥~0.01\% inorganic sulfidic S ; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  has a pH (1:1 by mass in water, or in a minimum of water to permit
  measurement) of ≥~4; \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  does not consist of \emph{hypersulfidic material}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-44}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-44}}

Hyposulfidic material forms in similar environments to
\emph{hypersulfidic material} and morphologically may be
indistinguishable from it. However, it is less likely to be coarse in
texture. The hydrogen peroxide screening test (see \emph{hypersulfidic
material}) may also be indicative, but final assessment depends on
incubation testing. Field tests for fine earth carbonate may be used to
indicate whether the soil has some self-neutralizing capacity.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-58}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-58}}

Acidification of hyposulfidic material usually does not cause the
development of a \emph{thionic horizon}. \emph{Hypersulfidic material}
has the same criteria for inorganic sulfidic S and for the pH value but
is capable of severe acidification.

\emph{Limnic material} is formed as subaquatic deposits and usually

\item
  \emph{Diatomaceous earth}: mainly diatoms (siliceous), identifiable by
  irreversible changing of the matrix colour (Munsell colour value of 3

Organic material (from Greek \emph{organon}, tool) has large amounts of
organic matter in the fine earth and/or contains many dead thin plant
remnants. It may show different stages of decomposition. If still
connected to living plants (e.g.~\emph{Sphagnum} mosses), it may even be
completely undecomposed. If derived from fallen organic residues, it is
decomposed to at least the extent that it is not loose and/or that
recognizable dead plant tissues comprise ≤~90\% of the volume (related
to the fine earth plus all dead plant remnants). Fallen organic residues
with \textgreater~90\% recognizable dead plant tissues and still loose
are called litter layer (see Chapter 2.1, General rules, and Annex 1,
Chapters 8.3.1 and 8.3.2) and are not considered for classification in
WRB. (Litter layers are temporally and spatially extremely variable in
thickness). On the other hand, decomposition may be advanced until no
recognizable dead plant tissues remain, and a homogeneous organic soil
mass results. Organic material accumulates under both wet and dry
conditions. The mineral component of the fine earth has a limited
influence on soil properties.

\hypertarget{general-description-67}{%
\subsubsection{General description}\label{general-description-67}}

Solimovic material (from Latin \emph{solum}, soil, and \emph{movere}, to
move) is a heterogeneous mixture of material that has moved downslope,
suspended in water. It is dominated by material that underwent soil
formation at its original place, e.g.~organic matter accumulation or the
formation of Fe oxides. It has been transported as a result of erosional
wash or soil creep, and the transport may have been accelerated by
land-use practices (e.g.~deforestation, ploughing, downhill tillage,
structure degradation). Solimovic material has been formed in relatively
recent times (mostly Holocene). It normally accumulates in slope
positions, in depressions or above a barrier on a low-grade slope. The
barrier may be natural or human-made (e.g.~hedge walls, terraces,
benches). After deposition, there was no advanced soil formation.

\hypertarget{diagnostic-criteria-73}{%
\subsubsection{Diagnostic criteria}\label{diagnostic-criteria-73}}

Solimovic material is mineral material and:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  is found on slopes, footslopes, toeslopes, fans, in depressions, above
  barriers, along gullies or similar relief positions, originating from
  upslope positions where it was subject to diffuse erosion;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  is not of fluviatile, lacustrine, marine or mass movement origin;
  \textbf{\emph{and}}
\item
  one or more of the following:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    if burying a mineral soil, it has a lower bulk density than the
    uppermost layer of the buried soil; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    has ≥~0.6\% soil organic carbon; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    has a Munsell colour chroma of ≥~3, moist; \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    contains artefacts and/or black carbon of any size;
    \textbf{\emph{or}}
  \item
    has ≥~100~mg~kg\textsuperscript{-1} P in the Mehlich-3 extract;
    \textbf{\emph{and}}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  does not form part of a diagnostic horizon other than a \emph{cambic},
  \emph{chernic}, \emph{mollic} or \emph{umbric horizon}.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{field-identification-46}{%
\subsubsection{Field identification}\label{field-identification-46}}

The fine earth of solimovic material can be of any particle size. Some
small coarse fragments may be included. Solimovic material is generally
imperfectly sorted. It may show some gross stratification, but
stratification is not a typical feature due to the diffuse or chaotic
nature of the deposition process. Solimovic material tends to occupy
gently sloping to moderately steep sloping (2-30\%) areas. Black carbon
or small \emph{artefacts} such as pieces of bricks, ceramics and glass
may be present in solimovic material. In many cases, solimovic material
has a \emph{lithic discontinuity} at its base.

The upper part of the solimovic material shows characteristics (fine
earth texture, colour, pH and \emph{soil organic carbon} content)
similar to the surface layer of the source in the neighbourhood. In
extreme cases, the profile in the solimovic material mirrors the eroded
soil profile of upward slope positions, with topsoil material buried
under former subsoil material. Good indication in a landscape is varying
colour of the soil surface between convex and concave positions.

\hypertarget{additional-information-34}{%
\subsubsection{Additional information}\label{additional-information-34}}

Accumulations by rapid mass movements such as in landslides, slumps or
tree throws do not meet the set of diagnostic criteria of solimovic
material.

In agricultural environments, solimovic material has mostly a high base
saturation. If not natural, this is the result of liming or
fertilization before and/or after having been eroded.

In former editions of WRB, the solimovic material was called colluvic
material. However, the traditional use of the word `colluvium' is so
different between countries and national traditions and changed so much
over time (Miller \& Juilleret, 2020) that it is better to avoid this
term and use a new one.

\hypertarget{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-63}{%
\subsubsection{Relationships with some other
diagnostics}\label{relationships-with-some-other-diagnostics-63}}

Solimovic material is not associated with perennial water bodies
(e.g.~rivers, lakes, the sea) and can therefore be distinguished from
\emph{fluvic material}. However, in toeslope positions, \emph{fluvic}
and solimovic material may be sedimented alternatingly or grade into
each other and may be difficult to differentiate.

Solimovic material is not purposefully added as, e.g., the soil material
in \emph{terric horizons}.

Tephric material refers to the fine earth, but coarse fragments may also

\chapter{Definitions of qualifiers}\label{definitions-of-qualifiers}}

{\textbf{Before using the qualifiers, please read the `Rules for naming
soils' (Chapter 2).}}

The definitions of the qualifiers for the second-level units relate to
RSGs, diagnostic horizons, properties and materials, and to attributes
such as colour, chemical conditions, texture, etc. References to the
RSGs defined in Chapter 4 and the diagnostics listed in Chapter 3 are
shown \emph{in italics}.

Usually, only a limited number of combinations will be possible in a
soil name; many of the definitions make the qualifiers mutually
exclusive.

\hypertarget{general-rules}{%
\section{General rules}\label{general-rules}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \textbf{Subqualifiers} (see Chapter 2.3), \textbf{which may be used in
  the soil name instead of the qualifier listed in the Key} (Chapter 4),
  are found beneath the definition of the respective qualifier
  (e.g.~Protocalcic is found under Calcic). \textbf{Subqualifiers, which
  cannot replace a listed qualifier}, are found in alphabetical order
  (e.g.~Hyperalic).
\item
  If a subqualifier (\textbf{optional or additional subqualifier})
  related to depth requirements can be constructed by the user,
  \textbf{the figure indicates, which rule applies}: (1), (2), (3), (4),
  (5). If no figure is indicated, these subqualifiers cannot be
  constructed.

\subsection{Rules for the use of the codes for naming
soils}\label{rules-for-the-use-of-the-codes-for-naming-soils}}

At the first level of classification, the code of the RSG stands alone.

At the second level, the code starts with the RSG,\\
followed by a `-',\\
followed by the principal qualifiers according to the list from top to
bottom, with a `.' between them, followed by a `-',\\
followed by the supplementary qualifiers with a `.' between them:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  first, if applicable, the qualifiers related to the texture, if
  several ones apply, in the sequence from the top to the bottom of the
  profile,
\item
  then, all others in alphabetical order of the qualifier names (not in
  alphabetical order of their codes), if applicable, followed by a
  `-',\\
  followed by qualifiers that are not in the list for the particular
  RSG.
\end{itemize}

Subqualifiers (qualifiers combined with specifiers) are placed in the
order of the qualifiers as if they were used without the specifier.
Exceptions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  if used with a principal qualifier, the Proto-, Bathy- and Thapto-
  subqualifiers must shift to the supplementary qualifiers,
\item
  the list of supplementary qualifiers starts, if applicable, with the
  qualifiers related to the texture (see above). If one group of
  qualifiers is empty, the `-' is still included, if one of the
  following groups is not empty.
\end{itemize}

The resulting scheme is as follows:\\
RSG\{-\}{[}PQ1{[}.PQ2{]}etc{]}\{-\}{[}TQ1{[}.TQ2{]}etc{]}{[}SQ1{[}.SQ2{]}etc{]}\{-\}{[}NQ1{[}.NQ2{]}etc{]}

With: PQ = principal qualifier, with or without added specifiers, TQ =
supplementary qualifier related to texture, with or without added
specifiers, SQ = other supplementary qualifier, with or without added
specifiers, NQ = qualifier not listed for the particular RSG, with or
without added specifiers; etc = further qualifiers can be added in the
same way if necessary; elements in {[}{]} are listed if they apply;
elements in \{\} are necessary if elements follow.

\chapter{Annex 1: Field Guide}\label{annex-1-field-guide}}

This field guide helps describe soils. It provides all field
characteristics needed for WRB classification and some other general
field characteristics. This field guide is not supposed to be a
comprehensive manual. People using this guide must have basic knowledge
in soil science and experience in the field. In many soils, some of the
listed characteristics are not present. Every characteristic must be
reported in the soil description sheet (Annex 4, Chapter 11) using the
provided codes.

The field guide consists of six consecutive parts:

\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

\caption{Mini-profile}

\end{figure}

Select your area of interest and give it a distinct name, e.g., Gombori
Pass. Then select a location. For further exploration, use a Pürckhauer
or an Edelman auger. If using a Pürckhauer auger, drive it into the soil
vertically with a plastic hammer. Occasionally, turn the auger with the
help of the turning bar, especially in clay-rich soils. If the auger
hits a rock or big stone, take it out. You may try again a small
distance apart but be careful not to damage the auger. Drive the auger
in to a depth of 1 m if possible. If not, note the actual depth that was
reached. To take it out, turn it while pulling.

Now place the auger onto the ground. Cut the protruding soil material
with a knife and remove it to the side. Avoid contaminating one layer
with the removed material from another. Be aware that compaction inside
the auger may have occurred; the layer depths may therefore not be
accurate. Place a folding ruler aside the auger according to the
actually reached depth (Figure 8.2).

In most cases, the topsoil falls out of the auger. To investigate it in
more detail, always make a mini-profile close to where the auger was
driven in. It should be at least 25 cm deep and wide, and the profile
walls should be vertical and smooth. Now place a folding ruler inside
the profile in such a way that point 0 is at the soil surface (see
Chapter 8.3.1). For later reconstruction, it may help to take a picture
of the mini-profile (Figure 8.3).

The characteristics that can be described from the soil material in the
auger are marked with an asterisk (*) in Chapter 8.4.

\hypertarget{preparation-of-a-soil-profile}{%
\subsection{Preparation of a soil
profile}\label{preparation-of-a-soil-profile}}

The soil profile should be at least 1~m deep or reach the parent
material. On a slope, unless the parent material starts at smaller
depth, the profile depth (Figure 8.4) should be 1~m~/~cos(α). For the
decision if the thickness and depth criteria of the WRB are fulfilled
and when calculating element stocks (Prietzel \& Wiesmeier, 2019), the
layer thickness perpendicular to the slope is needed. This is calculated
multiplying the vertical thickness by cos(α).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./figure_8-4.png}

}

\caption{Correct profile depth when terrain is inclined}

\end{figure}

The profile should be 1~m wide. If on a slope, the profile wall must be
parallel to the contour lines. The material should be piled up to the
left and/or right side of the profile and must not be placed on top side
of the profile (the side of the profile wall). Never walk or place tools
on the side of the profile wall. It is recommended to collect the soil
material on two tarps, topsoil and subsoil separately. When refilling
the soil profile later, you should first fill in the subsoil and then
the topsoil.

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./figure_8-5.png}

}

\caption{Ideal soil profile. Always take the photo perpendicular to the
profile wall}

\end{figure}

Carefully prepare the profile wall: it must be strictly vertical and
smooth. Roots should be cut directly at the profile wall. Use an
appropriate tool to clean the profile wall horizontally and avoid
vertical smearing. Place the measuring tape in such a way that point 0
is at the soil surface (see Chapter 8.3.1). It should be at one side but
not touch the side walls. It must be strictly vertical and plane. It may
help to weight the bottom end of the tape with a stone or stick. Take a
photo. Hold the camera perpendicularly to the profile wall (Figure 8.5).
Avoid any inclination. Also take at least one picture of the surrounding
terrain and vegetation (Figure 8.6), e.g., the tree canopy. Make sure
you will be able to associate profile and photo later. If possible, save
and name the pictures the same day they are taken.

If you describe a soil profile that has been dug some time ago, the
topsoil may be disturbed. To describe the humus forms, you need a fresh
miniprofile nearby the soil profile.

\section{Description of surface
characteristics}\label{description-of-surface-characteristics}}

Surface characteristics can be detected on the soil surface without
looking into a soil profile.

\hypertarget{soil-surface}{%
\subsection{Soil surface}\label{soil-surface}}

A \textbf{litter layer} is a loose layer that contains \textgreater~90\%
(by volume, related to the fine earth plus all dead plant remnants)
recognizable dead plant tissues (e.g.~undecomposed leaves). Dead plant
material still connected to living plants (e.g.~dead parts of
\emph{Sphagnum} mosses) is not regarded to form part of a litter layer.
The \textbf{soil surface} (0~cm) is by convention the surface of the
soil after removing, if present, the litter layer and, if present, below
a layer of living plants (e.g.~living mosses). The \textbf{mineral soil
surface} is the upper limit of the uppermost mineral horizon (see
Chapter 2.1, General rules, and see Chapter 8.4.4).

\hypertarget{litter-layer}{%
\subsection{Litter layer}\label{litter-layer}}

Observe an area of 5~m x 5~m with the profile at its centre. Report the
average and the maximum thickness of the litter layer in cm (see Chapter
8.3.1). If there is no litter layer, report 0~cm as thickness.

\hypertarget{rock-outcrops}{%
\subsection{Rock outcrops}\label{rock-outcrops}}

Rock outcrops are exposures of bedrock. Observe an area (10~m x 10~m if
possible) with the profile at its centre. Report the percentage of the
area that is covered by rock outcrops. Also report in m the average
distance between rock outcrops and their size (average length of the
greatest dimension).

\hypertarget{coarse-surface-fragments}{%
\subsection{Coarse surface fragments}\label{coarse-surface-fragments}}

Coarse surface fragments are loose fragments lying at the soil surface,
including those partially exposed. Observe an area (5~m x 5~m if
possible) with the profile at its centre. The Table indicates the
average length of the greatest dimension in cm.

\bottomrule()
\end{longtable}

Report the total percentage of the area that is covered by coarse
surface fragments. In addition, report at least one and up to three size
classes and report the percentage of the area that is covered by the
coarse surface fragments of the respective size class, the dominant one
first.

\hypertarget{desert-features}{%
\subsection{Desert features}\label{desert-features}}

Coarse fragments that are constantly exposed to wind-blown sand may be
affected by abrasion, etching and polishing, which results in even
surfaces with sharp edges. These fragments are called ventifacts
(windkanters), and their totality is called desert pavement. Observe an
area of 5~m x 5~m with the profile at its centre and report the
percentage of ventifacts out of the coarse fragments \textgreater~2~cm
(greatest dimension).

Coarse fragments may show chemical weathering, which may lead to the
formation of oxides and an intense colour at their upper surfaces,
whereas there is no such weathering and therefore the original rock
colour at their lower surfaces. This intense colour at the upper
surfaces is called desert varnish. Observe an area of 5~m x 5~m with the
profile at its centre and report the percentage of coarse fragments
\textgreater~2~cm (greatest dimension) featuring desert varnish.

\hypertarget{patterned-ground}{%
\subsection{Patterned ground}\label{patterned-ground}}

Patterned ground is the result of material sorting due to freeze-thaw
cycles in permafrost regions. Report the sorting of coarse fragments
\textgreater~6~cm (greatest dimension) at the soil surface.

(5~m x 5~m if possible) with the profile at its centre. Report the
percentage of the area that has a surface crust.

\hypertarget{surface-cracks}{%
\subsection{Surface cracks}\label{surface-cracks}}

Cracks are fissures other than those attributed to soil structure (see
Chapter 8.4.10). If surface cracks are present, report the average width
of the cracks. If the soil surface between cracks of larger width
classes is regularly divided by cracks of smaller width classes, report
the two width classes. If different width classes occur randomly, just
report the dominant one. The continuity of cracks to a greater depth is
reported with the layer description (see Chapter 8.4.13). For every
width class, report the average distance between the cracks and the
spatial arrangement and persistence of the cracks.

\hypertarget{identification-of-layers-and-layer-depths}{%
\subsection{Identification of layers and layer
depths}\label{identification-of-layers-and-layer-depths}}

A \textbf{soil layer} is a zone in the soil, approximately parallel to
the soil surface, with properties different from layers above and/or
below it. If at least one of these properties is the result of
soil-forming processes, the layer is called a \textbf{soil horizon}. In
the following, the term `layer' is preferred to include layers, in which
soilforming processes did not occur.

A soil layer is identified by certain observable characteristics. Among
these characteristics are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Matrix colour
\item
  Redoximorphic features
\item
  Texture
\item
  Coarse fragments
\item
  Artefacts
\item
  Bulk density
\item
  Structure
\item
  Coatings and bridges
\item
  Cracks
\item
  Carbonates
\item
  Secondary carbonates
\item
  Secondary gypsum
\item
  Secondary silica
\item
  Cementation
\item
  Water saturation
\item
  Volcanic glasses
\item
  C\textsubscript{org} content
\item
  Human alterations
\end{itemize}

Wherever you observe a major difference in at least one of these
characteristics, set a layer boundary. Whenever a layer is too thick
(e.g.~\textgreater~30~cm), it may be wise to subdivide it into two or
more layers of more or less equal thickness for description. In certain
soils, it may also be wise to add additional layer limits at depths,
which you may need to check for the presence or absence of a diagnostic
horizon (e.g.~20~cm to check mollic or umbric horizons). Alluvial
sediments and tephra layers may be finely stratified. It may be
appropriate to combine several such strata to one layer for description.
In all other cases, different geological strata must not be combined to
one layer.

In the following headings, the (o), the (m), and the (o, m) indicate,
whether the described characteristic has to be reported in organic or in
mineral layers or in both (see Chapter 8.4.4). For organotechnic layers,
the user decides, which characteristics have to be described. The
asterisk (*) informs that the characteristic can also be reported in a
\emph{Pürckhauer} auger.

The layers are numbered consecutively from the soil surface (see Chapter
8.3.1) downwards. Report the upper and lower depth for every layer. If
the lower depth of the last layer is unknown, report the depth of the
profile with the + symbol as the layer's lower depth.

The following principles have to be considered for description (see
General rules, Chapter 2.1):

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  All data refer to the fine earth, unless stated otherwise. The fine
  earth comprises the soil constituents ≤~2~mm. The whole soil comprises
  fine earth, coarse fragments, artefacts and dead plant remnants of any
  size. These rules also apply to cemented layers.
\item
  All data are given by mass, unless stated otherwise.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Layer consisting of different
parts}\label{layer-consisting-of-different-parts}}

If a layer consists of two or more different parts that do not form
horizontal layers but can easily be distinguished, describe them
separately. Use separate lines in the Soil Description Sheet (Annex 4,
Chapter 11) and report the percentage (by exposed area, related to the
whole soil) of each part. Examples are layers with retic properties (see
Chapter 8.4.18), with cryogenic alteration (see Chapter 8.4.34) or with
remodelling by single ploughing (see Chapter 8.4.39). The separation is
not recommended, if there is just a wavy boundary (as typical, e.g., for
chernic horizons or for eluvial horizons in Podzols, see Chapter 8.4.5)
or if there are just some additions of materials (see Chapter 8.4.39).

  Organic layers consist of organic material.
\item
  Organotechnic layers consist of organotechnic material.

An organic or organotechnic layer is called hydromorphic, if water
saturation lasts ≥~30 consecutive days in most years or if it has been
drained. Otherwise, it is called terrestrial. Hydromorphic organic
layers comprise peat and organic limnic material. Report, whether a
layer is organic, organotechnic or mineral and, if organic or
organotechnic, whether it is hydromorphic or terrestrial. The
distinction is preliminary and may have to be corrected according to
laboratory analyses.

\subsection{Structure (m)}\label{structure-m}}

Structure is the spatial arrangement of soil constituents and pores. If
this is, at least partially, the result of soil-forming processes, it is
called \textbf{soil structure}. Otherwise, it is \textbf{rock
structure}. Structure refers to the fine earth. Structure is reported
for mineral layers. Additionally, structure is reported for drained
hydromorphic organic layers.

A \textbf{soil aggregate} is a discrete structural body that can be
clearly distinguished from its surroundings and that results from
soil-forming processes. If a force is applied to a specimen, and the
specimen breaks along natural surfaces of weakness, it is composed of
aggregates. If the specimen breaks exactly where force is applied, the
structure is \textbf{massive} (coherent). If there is no coherence
between the particles, the structure is of \textbf{single-grain} type.
Human disturbance may create artificial structural elements, which are
called \textbf{clods}.

Undisturbed aggregates or non-aggregated structure are called the
first-level structure. Aggregates of the types subangular blocky,
angular blocky, polyhedral, lenticular, platy, wedge-shaped, prismatic,
and columnar may break into aggregates of a second-level structure and
even further into aggregates of a thirdlevel structure. The second-level
and the third-level structure may be of the same type(s) as the
first-level structure or of a different one.

Use the spade, take out a large sample, make sure that the aggregates of
the first-level structure, if present, are undisturbed, and observe the
structure. Report the type, if present, up to three, the dominant one
first. For each type, report separately grade, penetrability for roots,
and size class. If applicable, report two size classes, the dominant one
first. Report for every type and size class the abundance (as percentage
by volume of the layer).

From the first-level structure, take some specimens from each type (if
more than one size class of a type is present, take only the greater
one) and try to break them with low forces. If aggregates of a
second-level structure appear, report the type, if present, up to two,
the dominant one first. For each type, report separately grade, size
class, and penetrability for roots. If applicable, report two size
classes, the dominant one first. Report for every type and size class
the abundance (as percentage by volume of the respective first level
structure).

From the second-level structure, take some specimens from each type (if
more than one size class of a type is present, take only the greater
one) and try to break them with low forces. If aggregates of a
third-level structure appear, report type, grade, size class, and
penetrability for roots. If applicable, report two size classes, the
dominant one first. Report for every size class the abundance (as
percentage by volume of the respective second level structure).

striations. Striations develop if sand (or silt) grains are moved with
strong pressure along the aggregate surfaces. Stress features do not
differ in colour from the matrix (see Chapter 8.4.17). A hand lens

Use the Munsell Color Charts. Take a fresh sample, slightly crush it and
observe the colour in the shade (both your eyes and the colour chart in
the shade) and not in the twilight. Report hue, value and chroma. The
matrix colour is recorded twice, moist and (if possible) dry, the other
colours only in the moist state. The moist state corresponds to field
capacity, which is obtained with sufficient accuracy by moistening and
reading the colour as soon as visible moisture films have disappeared.

\hypertarget{matrix-colour-m}{%
\subsection{Matrix colour (m) (*)}\label{matrix-colour-m}}

Report the colour of the soil matrix. If there is more than one matrix
colour, report up to three, the dominant one first, and give the
percentage of the exposed area.

Advanced chemical weathering without physical alteration, especially
without turbation, results in saprolite (see Chapter 8.4.10). According
to the minerals present, a colour pattern may result. These colours are
reported as matrix colours.

\hypertarget{combinations-of-darker-coloured-finer-textured-and-lighter-coloured-coarser-textured-parts-m}{%
\subsection{Combinations of darker-coloured finer-textured and
lighter-coloured coarser-textured parts

If a layer consists of darker-coloured finer-textured and
lighter-coloured coarser-textured parts that do not form horizontal
layers but can easily be distinguished, describe them separately. Use
separate lines in the Soil Description Sheet (Annex 4, Chapter 11) and
give a full description. The principal colours are regarded to be matrix
colours.

For the coarser-textured parts, report in addition the following
characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the percentage (by exposed area) occupied by coarser-textured parts of
  any orientation (vertical, horizontal, inclined) having a width of
  ≥~0.5~cm
\item
  the percentage (by exposed area) occupied by continuous vertical
  tongues of coarser-textured parts with a horizontal extension of
  ≥~1~cm (if these tongues are absent, report 0\%)
\item
  the depth range, where these tongues cover ≥~10\% of the exposed area
  (if they extend across serveral layers, the length is only reported in
  the description of that layer, where they start at the layer's upper
  limit).
\end{itemize}

In the middle of the layer, prepare a horizontal surface, 50~cm x 50~cm,
and report the percentage (by horizontal area covered) of the
coarser-textured parts.

Redoximorphic features (oximorphic features plus reductimorphic
features) are the result of redox processes. Oximorphic features show
the accumulation of substances in oxidized state and usually a redder
hue, a higher chroma and a lower value than the surrounding material,
while reductimorphic features show the opposite characteristics. Soil
parts showing reductimorphic features may either contain substances in
reduced state or may have lost them.

Report substance, location, size (up to two, the dominant one first),
cementation class and abundance for each colour separately, for up to
three colours, the dominant one first. Substance for oximorphic features
is always reported, for reductimorphic features only in some cases. Size
is only reported for oximorphic features inside soil aggregates.
Cementation is only reported for oximorphic features. The abundance is
reported as percentage of the exposed area.

\hypertarget{redox-potential-and-reducing-conditions-o-m}{%
\subsection{Redox potential and reducing conditions (o,
m)}\label{redox-potential-and-reducing-conditions-o-m}}

The soil redox potential (Eh) expresses the ratio of the concentrations
of oxidized and reduced substances and is measured in millivolts (mV).
In soils, redox potentials range from +800 mV to --350 mV. A low redox
potential indicates strong reducing conditions. When opening a profile
pit, oxygen gets access to the profile wall, which leads to a rapid
oxidation of the exposed reduced substances and to a subsequent change
of the redox potential at the profile wall.

\hypertarget{measure-the-redox-potential-and-calculate-the-rh-value}{%
\subsubsection{Measure the redox potential and calculate the rH
value}\label{measure-the-redox-potential-and-calculate-the-rh-value}}

For measuring the redox potential (Blume et al., 2011; FAO, 2006), the
following equipment is needed:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a pointed stainless-steel rod of 4-5~mm in diameter, long enough to
  reach the desired soil depth
\item
  a perforated plastic tube of 15-20~mm in diameter and of a length
  corresponding to the depth of measurement
\item
  concentrated KCl solution, fixed with agar
\item
  a Pt electrode
\item
  a reference electrode, e.g., with Ag/AgCl in 1~\emph{M}~KCl or with
  calomel (as used for measuring the pH value)
\item
  a potentiometer.
\end{itemize}

Procedure: Step 1 - 2~m aside the profile pit and drive the rod into the
soil down to the desired depth, roughen the Pt electrode with
fine-grained sandpaper, intrude it immediately into the hole and press
it against the soil. Make another hole at 10-20~cm distance, wide and
deep enough to place a plastic tube that is some cm longer than the
depth of the Pt electrode. Fill the tube with the fixed KCl solution,
place the tube into the hole and fix it with soil material. Then, place
the reference electrode into the KCl solution. Connect the electrodes
with the potentiometer and read the voltage after 30 minutes. Repeat
readings every 10 minutes until the value is stable. In some cases, this
may take several hours. At least two replicates are recommended. (If you
dispose of more than one set of equipment, you may measure the redox
potential simultaneously at different soil depths.) The obtained voltage
has to be adjusted to the voltage of the standard hydrogen electrode:
for Ag/AgCl in 1~\emph{M}~KCl add +244~mV, for calomel add +287~mV.
Simultaneously, measure the pH value (see Chapter 8.4.29) of the soil at
the profile wall in distilled water (soil:water = 1:5) at the same
depth. Report the rH value that is calculated with the following
equation: rH = (2~Eh/59) + 2~pH

Note: If the profile is freshly dug and not too sandy, you may also
place the electrodes horizontally at least 15 cm behind in the profile

\subsubsection{Estimate the rH value (*)}\label{estimate-the-rh-value}}

The following field tests are available to prove reducing conditions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Methane can be lit with a match.
\item
  H\textsubscript{2}S is formed when spraying a soil sample with a
  10\%~HCl solution and can be identified by the odour of rotten eggs.
\item
  Fe\textsuperscript{2+} can be proven by oxidation with a 0.2\% (mass
  by volume) solution of α,α-dipyridyl dissolved in 1~\emph{N} ammonium
  acetate (NH\textsubscript{4}OAc), pH~7. Take a soil sample and spray
  it with the solution. If Fe\textsuperscript{2+} is present, a strong
  red colour will develop. The test needs a freshly broken sample that
  has not yet been oxidized at the open profile wall. In neutral to
  alkaline soils, the colour is hardly visible. Caution: The solution is
  slightly toxic.
\end{itemize}

The following Table explains how to estimate the rH value using these
field tests and the observed redoximorphic features (see Chapter
8.4.20). Report the rH range. Note that oximorphic features may be
relic. Reductimorphic features may also be relic, if Fe and Mn have been
removed in reduced form leaving behind a layer virtually free of Fe and
Mn.

A major process of chemical weathering is the formation of Fe oxides
(including hydroxides and oxidehydroxides). If the weathering is
initial, the Fe oxides may be concentrated in soil parts with easy
access to oxygen, e.g.~along pores. These parts have a distinctly redder
hue or stronger chroma. Report the abundance as percentage of the

\subsubsection{Clay coatings and clay
bridges}\label{clay-coatings-and-clay-bridges}}

Illuviated clay consists of clay minerals, mostly together with oxides
and in many cases together with organic matter. It covers surfaces of
soil aggregates, coarse fragments and biopore walls as coatings
(argillans), or it forms bridges between sand grains. The clay minerals
give the coatings a shiny appearance. The oxides provide a colour that
is more intensive (usually a higher Munsell chroma) than the colour of
the matrix; organic matter provides a darker colour (usually a lower
Munsell value) than the colour of the matrix (see Chapter 8.4.17). A
hand lens (maximum 10x) may be helpful.

Report the abundance of

  fragments and/or biopore walls
\item

\item

\end{itemize}

Gypsum is soft and can easily be ripped with a knife or broken between
thumbnail and forefinger. Gypsum is very soluble, and when gypsum is
found in soils that are not in extremely arid conditions, it can be
assumed that it is secondary in almost all cases. Contrary to that,
gypsiferous rocks and their fragments are primary. Fibrous gypsum, when
occurring along veins within limestones or sandstones is also primary.

\hypertarget{readily-soluble-salts-o-m}{%
\subsection{Readily soluble salts (o,
m)}\label{readily-soluble-salts-o-m}}

Readily soluble salts are precipitated in dry soil and dissolved in
moist soil. They are more soluble than gypsum. The presence of readily
soluble salts is checked by measuring the electrical conductivity in the
saturation extract (EC\textsubscript{SE}). In the saturation extract,
the soil is completely moist, but has no visible water surplus. This is
not easy to achieve.

Alternatively, one can measure the electrical conductivity in an extract
of 10~g soil with 25~ml aqua dest. (EC\textsubscript{2.5}). Mix soil and
water carefully, let it rest for at least 30 minutes and measure the
electrical conductivity in the clear solution in
dS~m\textsuperscript{-1}. It must then be transformed into the
EC\textsubscript{SE} according to the following equation:
EC\textsubscript{SE} = 250 x EC\textsubscript{2.5} x
(WC\textsubscript{SE})\textsuperscript{-1}.

WC\textsubscript{SE} is the water content in the saturation extract. It
can be estimated in mineral soils from texture (see Chapter 8.4.9) and
Corg content (see Chapter 8.4.36) and in peat soils from the degree of
decomposition (see Chapter 8.4.41) with the help of the following
Tables. High amounts of coarse fragments reduce the water content.

Report the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract in
dS~m\textsuperscript{-1}.

colorimetric method only allows the pH measurement in distilled water,
while the potentiometric method allows the measurement in different
solutions.

forms. Submerge an indicator paper in the supernatant and report the
result.

Table 8.71 shows common solutions and mixing ratios. Mix air-dry soil
with the solution thoroughly. Allow the mixture to settle until a

\hypertarget{consistence-m}{%
\subsection{Consistence (m)}\label{consistence-m}}

Consistence is the degree and kind of cohesion and adhesion that soil
exhibits. This Chapter refers to the consistence of the matrix and of
non-redoximorphic features. For the consistence of redoximorphic
features, see Chapter 8.4.20. Consistence is reported separately for
cemented and non-cemented (parts of) layers. If a specimen of soil does
not fall into pieces by applying low forces, one has to check, whether
it is cemented.

\hypertarget{presence-and-volume-of-cementation}{%
\subsubsection{Presence and volume of
cementation}\label{presence-and-volume-of-cementation}}

For checking cementation, different specimens have to be taken,
depending on soil characteristics. For checking surface crusts and platy
aggregates, take a specimen that is approximately 1 to 1.5~cm long by
0.5~cm thick (or the thickness of occurrence, if \textless~0.5~cm
thick). In all other cases, take a specimen, around 2.6 to 3~cm long at
all dimensions. Take the specimen air-dried and submerge it in water for
at least 1 hour. If it slakes like forming a soup, it is not cemented.
Otherwise, it is cemented. Report the percentage (by volume, related to
the whole soil) of the layer that is cemented.

\hypertarget{cementing-agents-cemented-soil}{%

For checking this feature, different specimens have to be taken,
depending on soil characteristics. For checking surface crusts and platy
aggregates, take a specimen that is approximately 1 to 1.5~cm long by
0.5~cm thick (or the thickness of occurrence, if \textless~0.5~cm thick)
and apply force perpendicular to its greatest dimension. In all other
cases, take a specimen, around 2.6 to 3~cm long at all dimensions, and
apply force. Observe the force needed for failure and report the
cementation class (cemented soil) or the rupture resistance class
(non-cemented soil). The rupture resistance has to be detected in moist
soil and, if possible, also in dry soil. If specimens of the required
size are not obtainable, use the following equation to calculate the
stress at failure (Table 8.73 and Table 8.74) (Schoeneberger et al.,
2012):

(2.8~cm/cube length cm)\textsuperscript{2} x (estimated stress (N) at
failure)

e.g.~for a 5.6-cm cube {[}(2.8/5.6)\textsuperscript{2} x 20~N{]} = 5~N →

Measuring the penetration resistance is recommended for layers that are

Non-cemented soil should be at field capacity for measurement. Use a
penetrometer and report the penetration resistance in MPa. The
measurement should be repeated at least five times to calculate a
reliable average value.

\hypertarget{surface-crusts-m}{%
\subsection{Surface crusts (m)}\label{surface-crusts-m}}

A crust is a thin layer of soil constituents bound together into a
horizontal mat or into small polygonal plates (see Schoeneberger et al.,
2012). Soil crusts develop in the first mineral layer(s) and are formed
by a sealing agent of physical, chemical and/or biological origin. The
characteristics of the crust are different from the underlying layers.
Typically, soil crusts change the infiltration rate and stabilize loose
soil aggregates. They may be present permanently or only when the soil
is dry. The area covered is reported in Chapter 8.3.7. They may be
cemented or not, which is reported in Chapter 8.4.30.

Report the sealing agent. If more than one is present, report up to
three, the dominant one first.

\hypertarget{andic-characteristics}{%
\subsubsection{Andic characteristics}\label{andic-characteristics}}

Andic properties are defined by laboratory data. In the field, one can
recognize a low bulk density, a dark colour and a high organic matter
content. In addition, there are two specific field tests indicative of
andic properties.

Thixotropy: Layers with andic properties show a high variable charge
allowing the absorption of much water that can easily be driven out by
shaking but will be absorbed again, after a while. Procedure: Take a
soil sample and make a sphere of about 2.5~cm in diameter. Wait until
any moisture films have disappeared. Place the sphere in cupped hands
and shake it. If moisture films appear at the surface of the sphere, the
soil shows thixotropy. After a while, the moisture films will disappear
again.

NaF test according to Fieldes and Perrott (1966), after FAO (2006): A
pH\textsubscript{NaF} of \textgreater~9.5 indicates the presence of
abundant allophanes and imogolites and/or organo-aluminium complexes.
Aluminium sorbs F\textsuperscript{-} ions while releasing
OH\textsuperscript{-} ions. The test is indicative for most layers with
andic properties, except for those very rich in organic matter. However,
the same reaction occurs in spodic horizons and in acidic clayey soils
that are rich in aluminium-interlayered clay minerals; soils with free
carbonates also react. Before applying the NaF test, check the soil pH
in water or KCl (the NaF test is not suitable for alkaline soils) and
the presence of free carbonates (using the HCl test). Procedure: Place a
small amount of soil on a filter paper previously soaked in
phenolphthalein and add some drops of 1~M~NaF (adjusted to pH~7.5). A
positive reaction is indicated by a fast change to an intense red
colour. Alternatively, measure the pH of a suspension of 1~g soil in
50~ml 1~M~NaF (adjusted to pH~7.5) after waiting 2 minutes. A pH of
\textgreater~9.5 is an indication of andic properties.

This Chapter refers to accumulations of organic matter in form of
discrete bodies. They have usually a lower value than the surrounding
material. Report here all accumulations that are natural or that are a
side effect of human activities. Additions of artefacts see Chapter
8.4.8 and of human-transported material see Chapter 8.4.39. If black
carbon is purposefully made by humans, it is considered to be an
artefact. Organic matter accumulations due to animal activity are
reported twice, once here and once in Chapter 8.4.38.

\hypertarget{sampling}{%
\section{Sampling}\label{sampling}}

We describe here the sampling of the terrestrial organic surface layers
and the conventional and volumetric sampling of mineral layers, all for
the standard analyses described in Annex 2 (Chapter 9). Sampling of
other layers requires special techniques that are not described here.

\hypertarget{preparation-of-sampling-bags}{%
\subsection{Preparation of sampling
bags}\label{preparation-of-sampling-bags}}

Use strong, moisture-resistant bags (transparent, if possible) for
sampling. Write the sampling details twice: once on the bag and once on
a piece of paper to be put into the bag. If you want to transfer
sampling rings to the laboratory, write the sampling details on the
ring. Always use a permanent marker.

Write down the following details:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Profile name
\item
  Conventional (C) / Volumetric (V)
\item
  Layer upper and lower depth
\item
  Layer designation (see Annex 3, Chapter 10).
\end{itemize}

Example: \emph{Gombori Pass 1 - V - 0-10 cm - Ah.}

Make sure to seal the bags after filling in the sample.

\hypertarget{sampling-of-terrestrial-organic-surface-layers}{%
\subsection{Sampling of terrestrial organic surface
layers}\label{sampling-of-terrestrial-organic-surface-layers}}

For the terrestrial organic surface layers, use a quadratic steel frame,
for instance with 30 cm side length. Use a rubber hammer to drive the
frame through the organic surface layers and a few centimetres into the
mineral soil. The frame must enter the soil evenly, do not drive in one
side first and then the other. Collect the organic surface material
manually, sample the litter layer and the O horizons separately. Be very
careful to sample all organic surface material but no mineral soil.

\hypertarget{conventional-sampling-of-mineral-layers}{%
\subsection{Conventional sampling of mineral
layers}\label{conventional-sampling-of-mineral-layers}}

Use a scraper to sample every layer separately and along its entire
height and width. Start with the lowest layer. Make sure that you only
sample one layer at a time, avoid that material from one layer falls
into the other.

\hypertarget{volumetric-sampling-of-mineral-layers}{%
\subsection{Volumetric sampling of mineral
layers}\label{volumetric-sampling-of-mineral-layers}}

At the soil surface, determine an area large enough for the appropriate
number of sampling rings (e.g.~3 rings). The area must be adjacent to
the profile wall and close to the measuring tape. In this area, remove
the organic surface layers and start sampling layer by layer from top to
down. The thickness of a mineral layer may be larger or smaller than the
height of a sampling ring or it may be equal (Figure 8.22).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics{./figure_8-22.png}

}

\caption{Volumetric sampling}

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\alph{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  If the thickness of the layer is larger, subtract the height of the
  sampling ring from the layer thickness and divide the difference by 2.
  This result equals the thickness of soil material that has to be
  removed starting from the upper layer boundary.
\item
  If the thickness of the layer is equal, it is very important that the
  surface is plane.
\item
  If the thickness of the layer is smaller, you will need the thickness
  of the layer in relation to the height of the sampling ring for
  calculating the sampled volume.
\end{enumerate}

For each layer, form a plane surface. If the soil is dryer than field
capacity, moisten the surface slowly with water from a spray bottle.
Wait until the soil is moist, avoid a water surplus. Then drive in the
sampling rings slowly and completely but avoid compacting soil material.
For driving in the sampling rings, use a hammer and a piece of wood. The
piece should be made of durable wood and have plane surfaces at the top
and the bottom. It should be just large enough to cover one sampling
ring. If the ring does not move in without deforming, stop driving it
in. Try to find a better position.

To take out the rings, penetrate the soil with a spatula just beneath
the ring and take it out. If the soil is hard to penetrate, you may use
a knife with a serrated blade (bread knife). When necessary, cut roots
off. When taking the rings out, make sure that no soil material is lost
from inside the rings. Place a cap on the top side and turn the ring
upside down. Now make the bottom surface plane and place another cap.

If you want to do further physical analyses, transfer the ring to the
laboratory. If the layer thickness is smaller than the height of the
ring (case c), fill up the volume with a resin. If you just want to
determine the soil mass, you may empty the soil material from the ring
into the designated bag and reuse the ring.

To determine the soil mass of a sample of a certain volume, you may also
use coated clods (see Annex 2, Chapter 9.5).

\hypertarget{sample-preparation}{%
\section{Sample preparation}\label{sample-preparation}}

Samples are air-dried or alternatively oven-dried at a maximum of 40~°C.
The fine earth is obtained by sieving the dry sample with a 2~mm sieve.
Clods not passing through the sieve are crushed (not ground) and sieved
again. Coarse fragments and roots not passing through the sieve are
treated separately.

In special cases where air-drying causes unacceptable irreversible
changes in certain soil properties (e.g.~in peat and in soils with
\emph{andic properties}), samples are kept and treated in the
field-moist state. These samples should be kept under cool conditions
and analyzed within a few weeks after sampling.

\hypertarget{moisture-content}{%

Calculation of contents is done on the basis of dry (105~°C) soil mass.

\hypertarget{particle-size-analysis}{%
\section{Particle-size analysis}\label{particle-size-analysis}}

The mineral part of the soil is separated into various size fractions
and the proportion of these fractions is determined. The determination
comprises all material, i.e.~including coarse fragments, but the
procedure itself is applied to the fine earth (≤~2~mm) only. The
particle-size classes according to ISO 11277:2009 are given in the
Table:

The pre-treatment of the sample is aimed at complete dispersion of the
primary particles. Therefore, cementing materials (usually of secondary
origin) such as organic matter and calcium carbonate may have to be
removed. In some cases, de-ferration also needs to be applied. The
amount of cementing material has to be documented. However, depending on
the aim of study, it may be fundamentally wrong to remove cementing
materials. Thus, all pre-treatments are considered optional. However,
for soil characterization purposes, removal of organic matter by H2O2
and of carbonates by HCl is routinely carried out. After this
pre-treatment, the sample is shaken with a dispersing agent and sand is
separated from clay and silt with a 63-μm sieve. The sand is
fractionated by dry sieving; the clay and silt fractions are determined
by the pipette method or, alternatively, by the hydrometer method.

\hypertarget{water-dispersible-clay}{%
\section{Water-dispersible clay}\label{water-dispersible-clay}}

This is the clay content found when the sample is dispersed with water
without any pre-treatment to remove cementing compounds and without use
of a dispersing agent. The proportion of water-dispersible clay to total
clay can be used as a structure stability indicator.

\hypertarget{bulk-density}{%
\section{Bulk density}\label{bulk-density}}

Density is defined as mass per unit volume. Soil bulk density is the
ratio of the mass of solids to the total or bulk volume and is given at
dry state. This total volume includes the volume of both solids and pore
space. The volume and therefore the bulk density changes with swelling
and shrinking, which is related to the water content. For that reason,
the water status of the sample prior to drying must be specified.

Two different procedures can be used:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Undisturbed core samples.} A metal cylinder of known volume is
  pressed into the soil. The moist sample mass is recorded. This may be
  the field-moist state or the state after equilibrating the sample at a
  specified water tension. The sample is then dried at 105~°C and
  weighed again. The bulk density is the ratio of dry mass to volume
  (related to the determined water content and/or the specified water
  tension).
\item
  \emph{Coated clods.} Field-occurring clods are coated with plastic
  lacquer (e.g.~Saran dissolved in methyl ethyl ketone) to allow
  underwater determination. This gives the volume of the clod. The moist
  sample mass is recorded. This may be the field-moist state or the
  state after equilibrating the clod at a specified water tension. The
  sample is then dried at 105~°C and weighed again. The bulk density is
  the ratio of dry mass to volume (related to the determined water
  content and/or the specified water tension).
\end{itemize}

If the sample contains many coarse fragments, the coarse fragments are
sieved out after drying and then their mass and volume are determined
separately. With that, the bulk density of the fine earth is calculated.
The determination of bulk density is very sensitive to natural
variability, particularly caused by nonrepresentativeness of the samples
(coarse fragments, cementations, cracks, roots, etc.). Therefore,
determinations should always be made at least in triplicate.

\hypertarget{coefficient-of-linear-extensibility-cole}{%
\section{Coefficient of linear extensibility
(COLE)}\label{coefficient-of-linear-extensibility-cole}}

The COLE gives an indication of the reversible shrink--swell capacity of
a soil. It is calculated as the ratio of the difference between the
moist length and the dry length of a clod to its dry length:
(L\textsubscript{m} - L\textsubscript{d})/L\textsubscript{d}, in which
L\textsubscript{m} is the length at 33~kPa tension and Ld the length
when dry (105~°C).

\hypertarget{ph}{%
\section{pH}\label{ph}}

The pH of the soil is measured potentiometrically in the supernatant
suspension of a soil:liquid mixture. If not stated otherwise,
soil:liquid are in a ratio of 1:5 (volume:volume) (according to ISO
standards). The liquid is either distilled water (pHwater) or a
1~\emph{M}~KCl solution (pH\textsubscript{KCl}). However, in some
definitions, a 1:1 soil:water ratio is used.

\hypertarget{organic-carbon}{%
\section{Organic carbon}\label{organic-carbon}}

Many laboratories use auto-analysers (e.g.~dry combustion). In these
cases, a qualitative test for carbonates on effervescence with HCl is
recommended, and if applicable, a correction for inorganic C (see
Chapter 9.9) is required.

Otherwise, the \emph{Walkley--Black method} is followed. This involves a
wet combustion of the organic matter with a mixture of potassium
dichromate and sulfuric acid at about 125~°C. The residual dichromate is
titrated against ferrous sulfate. To compensate for incomplete
destruction, an empirical correction factor of 1.3 is applied in the
calculation of the result.

\hypertarget{carbonates}{%
\section{Carbonates}\label{carbonates}}

The \emph{rapid titration method} by Piper (also called \emph{acid
neutralization method}) is used. The sample is treated with dilute HCl
and the residual acid is titrated. The results are referred to as
\emph{calcium carbonate equivalent} as the dissolution is not selective
for calcite, and other carbonates such as dolomite are dissolved as
well.

\textbf{\emph{Note:}} Other procedures such as the \emph{Scheibler
volumetric method} or the \emph{Bernard calcimeter} may also be used.

\hypertarget{gypsum}{%
\section{Gypsum}\label{gypsum}}

Gypsum is dissolved by shaking the sample with water. It is then
selectively precipitated from the extract by adding acetone. This
precipitate is re-dissolved in water and the Ca concentration is
determined as a measure for gypsum. This method also extracts anhydrite.

\hypertarget{cation-exchange-capacity-cec-and-exchangeable-base-cations}{%
\section{Cation exchange capacity (CEC) and exchangeable base
cations}\label{cation-exchange-capacity-cec-and-exchangeable-base-cations}}

The ammonium acetate pH 7 method is used. In saline soils, the readily
soluble salts have to be washed out before starting the procedure. The
sample is percolated with ammonium acetate (pH 7) and the base cations
are measured in the percolate. The sample is subsequently percolated
with sodium acetate (pH 7), the excess salt is then removed and the
adsorbed Na exchanged by percolation with ammonium acetate (pH 7). The
Na in this percolate is a measure for the CEC.

Alternatively, after percolation with ammonium acetate, the sample can
be washed free of excess salt, the whole sample distilled and the
evolved ammonia determined.

Percolation in tubes may be replaced by shaking in flasks. Each
extraction must be repeated three times and the three extracts should be
combined for analysis.

\textbf{Note 1:} Other procedures for CEC may be used provided the
determination is done at pH 7.

\textbf{Note 2:} In special cases where CEC is not a diagnostic
criterion, e.g.~saline and alkaline soils, the CEC may be determined at
pH 8.2.

\textbf{Note 3:} The base saturation of saline, calcareous and gypseous
soils can be considered to be 100\%.

\hypertarget{exchangeable-aluminium-and-exchange-acidity}{%
\section{Exchangeable aluminium and exchange
acidity}\label{exchangeable-aluminium-and-exchange-acidity}}

Exchangeable Al is released upon exchange by an unbuffered
1~\emph{M}~KCl solution.

Exchange acidity is extracted by a barium chloride-triethanolamine
solution, buffered at pH 8.2. The extract is back-titrated with HCl.

\hypertarget{calculations-of-cec-and-exchangeable-cations}{%
\section{Calculations of CEC and exchangeable
cations}\label{calculations-of-cec-and-exchangeable-cations}}

These calculations are usually only provided for mineral material.

\hypertarget{cec}{%
\subsection{CEC}\label{cec}}

The CEC is given in cmolc kg\textsuperscript{-1} soil. The CEC
kg\textsuperscript{-1} clay is calculated by dividing the CEC
kg\textsuperscript{-1} soil by the clay content. Principally, this is
only correct if, before doing that, the CEC kg\textsuperscript{-1} soil
attributed to the organic matter is subtracted. But we do not have a
reliable method to detect the contribution of the organic matter to the
CEC. Therefore, it is recommended to do the calculation as if all the
CEC were provided by clay. If the organic matter content is low, the
error is negligible.

\hypertarget{saturations-at-ph-7}{%
\subsection{Saturations at pH 7}\label{saturations-at-ph-7}}

The base saturation (BS) refers to the exchangeable base cations and is
calculated as:\\
exchangeable (Ca+Mg+K+Na) x 100 / CEC.

The exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) is calculated as:\\
exchangeable Na x 100 / CEC.

The input data are given in cmol\textsubscript{c} kg\textsuperscript{-1}
and the results in \%.

If the data for the base saturation are not available, the
pH\textsubscript{water} can be used instead. If this is also not
available, the pH\textsubscript{KCl} can be used. The correlations
between base saturation and pH depend on the amount of organic matter
and show an extremely high variance. The following pH values are
recommended for a base saturation of 50\%:

Exchangeable ions are given in cmol\textsubscript{c}
kg\textsuperscript{-1}. For some soils, the relationship between the sum
of exchangeable base cations and exchangeable Al is required. If the
data for exchangeable ions are not available, the pHwater can be used
instead. If this is also not available, the pHKCl can be used. The
correlations between exchangeable ions and pH depend on the amount of
organic matter and show an extremely high variance. The following pH

\textbf{Note:} Al\textsubscript{dith} and Mn\textsubscript{ox} are not
used for definitions in WRB. For further review of methods see Rennert
(2019).

\hypertarget{salinity}{%
\section{Salinity}\label{salinity}}

Attributes associated with salinity in soils are determined in the
saturation extract. The attributes include: pH, electrical conductivity
(EC\textsubscript{e}), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and the cations and
anions of the dissolved salts. These include Ca, Mg, Na, K, carbonate
and bicarbonate, chloride, nitrate and sulfate. The SAR and the
exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) may be estimated from the
concentrations of the dissolved cations.

The determination in the saturation extract is often difficult.
Alternatively, the conductivity and the cations and anions may be
detected in a 1:2.5 solution and recalculated to the saturation extract
(see Chapter 8.4.28).

\hypertarget{mineralogical-analysis-of-the-sand-fraction}{%
\section{Mineralogical analysis of the sand

After removal of cementing and coating materials, the sand is separated
from the clay and silt by wet sieving. From the sand, the fraction
63--420~μm is separated by dry sieving. This fraction is divided into a
heavy fraction and a \emph{light} fraction with the aid of a
high-density liquid: a solution of sodium polytungstate with a specific
density of 2.85~kg~dm\textsuperscript{-3}. Of the \emph{heavy fraction},
a microscopic slide is made; the \emph{light fraction} is stained
selectively for microscopic identification of feldspars and quartz. The
analysis requires a petrographic microscope.

Volcanic glass can usually be recognized as isotropic grains with
vesicles.

\hypertarget{x-ray-diffractometry}{%

There are two methods to analyze the total content of elements: XRD (see

Reduced inorganic S is converted to H\textsubscript{2}S by a hot acidic
CrCl\textsubscript{2} solution. The evolved H\textsubscript{2}S is
trapped quantitatively in a Zn acetate solution as solid ZnS. The ZnS is
then treated with HCl to release H\textsubscript{2}S into solution,
which is quickly titrated with I\textsubscript{2} solution to the
blue-coloured end point indicated by the reaction of I\textsubscript{2}
with starch (Sullivan et al., 2000). Caution: Toxic residues have to be
managed carefully.

\chapter{Annex 3: Horizon and layer
designations}\label{annex-3-horizon-and-layer-designations}}

This annex provides the horizon and layer symbols for soil description.
The designations are based on field characteristics (Annex 1, Chapter 8)
and laboratory characteristics (Annex 2, Chapter 9). In some cases, the
processes that have led to these characteristics, may no longer be
active. \textbf{Only brief descriptions are given here, which are not
intended to be definitions as in the diagnostics of the WRB}. In most
cases, no quantitative criteria are given.

A \textbf{soil layer} is a zone in the soil, approximately parallel to
the soil surface, with properties different from layers above and/or
below it. If at least one of these properties is the result of
soil-forming processes, the layer is called a \textbf{soil horizon}. In
the following, the term layer is used to indicate the possibility that
soilforming processes did not occur. A \textbf{stratum} (see Chapter
10.4) is the result of geological processes and may comprise more than
one layer.

A \textbf{litter layer} is a loose layer that contains \textgreater~90\%
(by volume, related to the fine earth plus all dead plant remmants)
recognizable dead plant tissues (e.g.~undecomposed leaves). Dead plant
material still connected to living plants (e.g.~dead parts of
\emph{Sphagnum} mosses) is not regarded to form part of a litter layer.
The \textbf{soil surface} (0 cm) is by convention the surface of the
soil after removing, if present, the litter layer and, if present, below
a layer of living plants (e.g.~living mosses). The \textbf{mineral soil
surface} is the upper limit of the uppermost mineral horizon (see
Chapter 2.1, General rules, and Annex 1, Chapters 8.3.1 and 8.3.2).

The \textbf{fine earth} comprises the soil constituents ≤~2~mm. The
\textbf{whole soil} comprises fine earth, coarse fragments, artefacts
and dead plant remnants of any size. These rules also apply to cemented
layers (see Chapter 2.1, General rules, and Annex 1, Chapters 8.3.1 and
8.3.2).

We distinguish the following layers (see Chapter 3.3):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Organic layers consist of organic material.
\item
  Organotechnic layers consist of organotechnic material.
\item
  Mineral layers are all other layers.
\end{itemize}

The designation consists of a capital letter (master symbol), which in
most cases is followed by one or more lowercase letters (suffixes).
Rules are given for the combinations of symbols in one layer and for
layer sequences.

The word \textbf{rock} comprises both consolidated and unconsolidated
material. The word \textbf{oxides}, in the following, includes oxides,
hydroxides and oxide-hydroxides.

I and W layers have no suffixes.

Combination of suffixes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  The c follows the suffix that indicates the substance that forms the
  concretions or nodules; if this is true for more than one suffix, each
  one is followed by the c.
\item
  The m follows the suffix that indicates the substance that is the
  cementing agent; if this is true for more than one suffix, each one is
  followed by the m.
\item
  The ρ follows the suffix that indicates the relict features; if this
  is true for more than one suffix, each one is followed by the ρ.
\item
  If two suffixes belong to the same soil-forming process, they follow
  each other immediately; in the combination of t and n, the t is
  written first; rules 1, 2 and 3 have to be followed, if applicable.
  Examples: Btn, Bhs, Bsh, Bhsm, Bsmh.
\item
  If in a B horizon the characteristics of the suffixes g, h, k, l, o,
  q, s, t, v, or y are strongly expressed, the suffix w is not used,
  even if its characteristics are present; if the characteristics of the
  mentioned suffixes are weakly expressed and the characteristics of the
  suffix w are present as well, the suffixes are combined. Examples: Bwt
  (weak illuvial accumulation of clay minerals; characteristics of w
  present), Btw (intermediate illuvial accumulation of clay minerals;
  characteristics of w present), Bt (strong illuvial accumulation of
  clay minerals; characteristics of w present),\\
  Nota bene: If the characteristics of the B horizon are absent (≥ 50 \%
  rock structure, by volume, related to the fine earth), the horizon is
  named Ct.
\item
  In H and O layers, the i, e or a is written first.
\item
  The @, f and b are written last, if b occurs together with @ or f
  (only if other suffixes are present as well): @b, fb.
\item
  Besides that, combinations must be in the sequence of dominance, the
  dominant one first. Examples: Btng, Btgb, Bkcyc.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{transitional-layers}{%
\section{Transitional layers}\label{transitional-layers}}

If the characteristics of two or more master layers are superimposed to
each other, the master symbols are combined without anything in between,
the dominant one first, each one followed by its suffixes. Examples:
AhBw, BwAh, AhE, EAh, EBg, BgE, BwC, CBw, BsC, CBs.

If the characteristics of two or more master layers occur in the same
depth range, but occupy distinct parts clearly separated from each
other, the master symbols are combined with the slash (/), the dominant
one first, each one followed by its suffixes.

Examples:\\
E/Bt (interfingering of E material into a Bt horizon),\\
C/Bt (Bt horizon forming lamellae within a C layer).

If a suffix applies to two or more master symbols, it is not repeated
and follows the first master symbol. Example: AhkBw (not: AhkBwk; not:
AhBwk).

W cannot be combined with other master symbols. H, O, I, and R can only
be combined using the slash.

\hypertarget{layer-sequences}{%
\section{Layer sequences}\label{layer-sequences}}

The sequence of the layers is from top to down with a hyphen in between.
Examples see Chapter 10.5.

If lithic discontinuities occur, the strata are indicated by preceding
figures, starting with the second stratum. I and W layers are not
considered as strata. All layers of the respective stratum are indicated
by the figure:\\
Example: Oi-Oe-Ah-E-2Bt-2C-3R.

If the suffix b occurs, the preceding figure and the suffix b are
combined.\\
Example: Oi-Oe-Ah-E-Bt-2Ahb-2Eb-2Btb-2C-3R.

If two or more layers with the same designation occur, the letters are
followed by figures. The sequence of figures continues across different
strata.\\
Examples:\\
Oi-Oe-Oa-Ah-Bw1-Bw2-2Bw3-3Ahb1-3Eb-3Btb-4Ahb2-4C,\\
Oi-He-Ha-Cr1-2Heb-2Hab-2Cr2-3Crγ.

sheet}\label{annex-4-soil-description-sheet}}

The soil description sheet is provided as an open source excel file on
the WRB homepage. For cells coloured in brown, a code is required. For
cells coloured in green, figures or free text are required. The excel
file representing the whole Annexes 1 (Chapter 8) and 3 (Chapter 10) is
relatively long. With the help of excel macros, you can change it into a
short version (explained in the excel file).

You may also prepare your individual short version. If you are sure that
in the area of your soil survey certain characteristics cannot occur,
you may delete the respective columns. (Example: If your survey is not
in a desert, you may delete the columns referring to desert features.)

\chapter{Annex 5: Guidance on database
set-up}\label{annex-5-guidance-on-database-set-up}}

Setting up a database for soil description and classification according
to WRB is not a simple task due to often conflicting requirements
regarding issues like

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Data evaluation aims and needs
\item
  Data reusability
\item
  Data quality
\item
  Data and system security
\item
  Performance of database operations
\item
  Experience of database administrators and users
\end{itemize}

and last but not least, the complex data structure necessary to cover
parameters with their auxiliary data and the complexity of WRB soil name
syntax.

The single-user one-project data collection can be done in a spreadsheet
approach, which is unsuitable for multi-user information systems that
need to maintain data security for decades. Introducing WRB 2022 into an
existing soil or even land information system asks for different
solutions than a newly set-up single-aim database. Even if we consider
the most widespread relational database approach, not all of the
database management systems provide any logical operation and further
possibilities foreseen in the \emph{Structured Query Language (SQL)},
and they differ largely in performance and the use of additional
programming.

The WRB homepage provides guidance and practice examples for database
solutions suited to the fourth edition of WRB.

\hypertarget{annex-6-colour-symbols-for-rsg-maps}{%
\chapter{Annex 6: Colour symbols for RSG
maps}\label{annex-6-colour-symbols-for-rsg-maps}}

This annex provides suggestions for colours in maps showing the RSGs.
The suggestions follow roughly the colour choices in the atlases edited
by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.

The guidelines for creating map legends are given in Chapter 2.5. A map
unit consists of

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  a dominant soil only
\item
  a dominant soil plus a codominant soil and/or one or more associated
  soils
\item
  one, two or three codominant soils with or without one or more
  associated soils. It is strongly recommended to indicate more than
  just one soil in the map units, because the restriction to only one
  soil gives often an insufficient or even misleading image.
\end{itemize}

It is recommended to use colour symbols and alphanumeric codes to allow
the map reader a correct identification of the mapping unit of each
polygon. (For raster datasets, only colours can be used.) The colour
represents the dominant soil or, if absent, the major codominant soil,
only. The other soils are indicated by adding alphanumeric codes. On the
first scale level, nothing else is required. If you add optional
qualifiers, use alphanumeric codes. The principal qualifiers added at
the second and third scale level are also indicated by alphanumeric
codes. These are selected by the soil scientist, who makes the map. In
complex mapping units with several soils, codominant and associated
soils may be mentioned in the mapping unit explanation, only.
