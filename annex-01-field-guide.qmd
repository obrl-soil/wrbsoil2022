# Annex 1: Field Guide {#sec-a1}

This field guide helps describe soils. It provides all field characteristics needed for WRB classification and some other general field characteristics. This field guide is not supposed to be a comprehensive manual. People using this guide must have basic knowledge in soil science and experience in the field. In many soils, some of the listed characteristics are not present. Every characteristic must be reported in the soil description sheet (Annex 4, [Chapter 11](annex-04-soil-description-sheet.qmd)) using the provided codes.

The field guide consists of six consecutive parts:

1.  Preparation work and general rules
2.  General data and description of soil-forming factors
3.  Description of surface characteristics
4.  Description of layers
5.  Sampling
6.  References

## Preparation work and general rules {#sec-a1-81}

### Exploration of an area of interest with auger and spade {#sec-a1-811}

Select your area of interest and give it a distinct name, e.g., Gombori Pass. Then select a location. For further exploration, use a Pürckhauer or an Edelman auger. If using a Pürckhauer auger, drive it into the soil vertically with a plastic hammer. Occasionally, turn the auger with the help of the turning bar, especially in clay-rich soils. If the auger hits a rock or big stone, take it out. You may try again a small distance apart but be careful not to damage the auger. Drive the auger in to a depth of 1 m if possible. If not, note the actual depth that was reached. To take it out, turn it while pulling.

Now place the auger onto the ground. Cut the protruding soil material with a knife and remove it to the side. Avoid contaminating one layer with the removed material from another. Be aware that compaction inside the auger may have occurred; the layer depths may therefore not be accurate. Place a folding ruler aside the auger according to the actually reached depth (@fig-a1-82).

In most cases, the topsoil falls out of the auger. To investigate it in more detail, always make a mini-profile close to where the auger was driven in. It should be at least 25 cm deep and wide, and the profile walls should be vertical and smooth. Now place a folding ruler inside the profile in such a way that point 0 is at the soil surface (see [Chapter 8.3.1](#fig-a1-831)). For later reconstruction, it may help to take a picture of the mini-profile (@fig-a1-83).

The characteristics that can be described from the soil material in the auger are marked with an asterisk (\*) in [Chapter 8.4](#sec-a1-84).

### Preparation of a soil profile {#sec-a1-812}

The soil profile should be at least 1 m deep or reach the parent material. On a slope, unless the parent material starts at smaller depth, the profile depth (@fig-a1-84) should be 1 m / cos(α). For the decision if the thickness and depth criteria of the WRB are fulfilled and when calculating element stocks [@prietzel2019] the layer thickness perpendicular to the slope is needed. This is calculated multiplying the vertical thickness by cos(α).

![Correct profile depth when terrain is inclined](images/figure_8-4.png){#fig-a1-84}

The profile should be 1 m wide. If on a slope, the profile wall must be parallel to the contour lines. The material should be piled up to the left and/or right side of the profile and must not be placed on top side of the profile (the side of the profile wall). Never walk or place tools on the side of the profile wall. It is recommended to collect the soil material on two tarps, topsoil and subsoil separately. When refilling the soil profile later, you should first fill in the subsoil and then the topsoil.

::: {grid-col-4}
![Ideal soil profile. Always take the photo perpendicular to the profile wall](images/figure_8-5.png){#fig-a1-85}
:::

::: {grid-col-8}
Carefully prepare the profile wall: it must be strictly vertical and smooth. Roots should be cut directly at the profile wall. Use an appropriate tool to clean the profile wall horizontally and avoid vertical smearing. Place the measuring tape in such a way that point 0 is at the soil surface (see [Chapter 8.3.1](#fig-a1-831)). It should be at one side but not touch the side walls. It must be strictly vertical and plane. It may help to weight the bottom end of the tape with a stone or stick. Take a photo. Hold the camera perpendicularly to the profile wall (@fig-a1-85). Avoid any inclination. Also take at least one picture of the surrounding terrain and vegetation (@fig-a1-86), e.g., the tree canopy. Make sure you will be able to associate profile and photo later. If possible, save and name the pictures the same day they are taken.

If you describe a soil profile that has been dug some time ago, the topsoil may be disturbed. To describe the humus forms, you need a fresh miniprofile nearby the soil profile.

## General data and description of soil-forming factors {#sec-a1-82}

This Chapter refers to some general data and to the soil-forming factors climate, landform and vegetation. Other soil-forming factors are described with the layer description.

### Date and authors {#sec-a1-821}

Report the date of description and the names of the describing authors.

### Location {#sec-a1-822}

Give the location a name and report it; e.g., *Gombori Pass 1*.\
Report the GPS coordinates.\
Report the altitude above sea level (a.s.l.); e.g., *106 m*.

### Landform and topography {#sec-a1-823}

This Chapter refers to the large-scale topography. For local surface unevenness, see [Chapter 8.3.11](#sec-a1-8311).

#### Gradient {#sec-a1-823-gr}

Report the ground surface inclination with respect to the horizontal plane. If the profile lies on a flat surface, the gradient is 0%. If it lies on a slope, make 2 records, one upslope and one downslope; e.g., *upslope: 18%, downslope: 16%*.

#### Slope aspect {#sec-a1-823-as}

If the profile lies on a slope, report the compass direction that the slope faces, viewed downslope; e.g., 225°.

![Slope aspect, Schoeneberger et al. [-@schoeneberger2012], 1-5](images/figure_8-7.png){#fig-a1-87}

#### Slope shape {#sec-a1-823-sh}

If the profile lies on a slope, report the slope shape in 2 directions: up-/downslope (perpendicular to the elevation contour, i.e. the vertical curvature) and across slope (along the elevation contour, i.e. the horizontal curvature); e.g., *Linear*, *Convex* or *Concave*.

![Slope Shape, Schoeneberger et al. [-@schoeneberger2012], 1-6](images/figure_8-8.png){#fig-a1-88}

#### Position of the soil profile (related to topography) {#sec-a1-823-tp}

If the profile lies in an uneven terrain, report the profile position.

### Vegetation and land use {#sec-a1-825}

This Chapter refers to all kinds of plant cover from completely natural to completely human-made. It is not a vegetation survey, and only the really soil-relevant characteristics are reported. If the land is cultivated as cropland or grassland, the cultivation type is reported. In all other cases, the vegetation type is reported. Observe an area (10 m x 10 m, if possible) with the profile at its centre.

#### Vegetation strata {#sec-a1-825-vs}

The following strata are relevant.

#### Vegetation height, cover and taxa {#sec-a1-825-vh}

For non-cultivated land, report the following characteristics:

-   Report the average height and the maximum height in m above ground for each stratum separately.
-   Report the vegetation cover. For the upper stratum and the mid-stratum, report the percentage (by area) of the crown cover. For the ground stratum, report the percentage (by area) of the ground cover.
-   Report up to three important species per stratum, e.g., *Fagus orientalis*. If you do not know the species, report the next higher taxonomic rank.

#### Actual or last cultivated species

For cultivated land, report the actual cultivated species using the scientific name, e.g., *Zea mays*. If currently under fallow, report the last species and indicate month and year of harvest or of cultivation cessation. If more than one species is/was grown simultaneously, report up to three in the sequence of the area covered, starting with the species that covers the largest area; this includes tree species in simultaneous agroforestry systems.

#### Rotational cultivated species

For cultivated land, report the species that have been cultivated in the last five years in rotation with the actual or last species. Report up to three in the sequence of frequency, starting with the most frequent species; this includes tree species in rotational agroforestry systems.

#### Special techniques to enhance site productivity

Report the techniques that refer to the surrounding area of the soil profile. Techniques that affect certain soil layers are reported for the respective layer. Techniques that cause surface unevenness have to be reported in [Chapter 8.3.11](#sec-a1-8311), additionally. If more than one type is present, report up to three, the dominant one first.

## Description of surface characteristics {#sec-a1-83}

Surface characteristics can be detected on the soil surface without looking into a soil profile.

### Soil surface {#fig-a1-831}

A **litter layer** is a loose layer that contains \> 90% (by volume, related to the fine earth plus all dead plant remnants) recognizable dead plant tissues (e.g. undecomposed leaves). Dead plant material still connected to living plants (e.g. dead parts of *Sphagnum* mosses) is not regarded to form part of a litter layer. The **soil surface** (0 cm) is by convention the surface of the soil after removing, if present, the litter layer and, if present, below a layer of living plants (e.g. living mosses). The **mineral soil surface** is the upper limit of the uppermost mineral horizon (see [Chapter 2.1](chapter-02.qmd#sec-gnrl), General rules, and see [Chapter 8.4.4](#sec-a1-844)).

### Litter layer {#sec-a1-832}

Observe an area of 5 m x 5 m with the profile at its centre. Report the average and the maximum thickness of the litter layer in cm (see [Chapter 8.3.1](#sec-a1-831)). If there is no litter layer, report 0 cm as thickness.

### Rock outcrops {#sec-a1-833}

Rock outcrops are exposures of bedrock. Observe an area (10 m x 10 m if possible) with the profile at its centre. Report the percentage of the area that is covered by rock outcrops. Also report in m the average distance between rock outcrops and their size (average length of the greatest dimension).

### Coarse surface fragments {#sec-a1-834}

Coarse surface fragments are loose fragments lying at the soil surface, including those partially exposed. Observe an area (5 m x 5 m if possible) with the profile at its centre. The Table indicates the average length of the greatest dimension in cm.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-a1811
#| tbl-cap:  Size of coarse surface fragments, FAO (2006), Table 15
#| tbl-colwidths: [40, 40, 20] 

tbl_a1811_dat <- tribble(
  ~size_cm, ~size_class,  ~Code,
  '> 0.2 - 0.6', 'Fine gravel',                 'F',
  '> 0.6 - 2',   'Medium gravel',               'M',

  tab_options(
    column_labels.font.weight = 'bold',
    heading.title.font.weight     = 'bold',
    table.align = 'left'
  ) |>
  tab_style(style = list(cell_text(weight = 'bold')),

  cols_label(size_cm    = 'Size (cm)',
             size_class = 'Size class')
  
tbl_a1811
```

Report the total percentage of the area that is covered by coarse surface fragments. In addition, report at least one and up to three size classes and report the percentage of the area that is covered by the coarse surface fragments of the respective size class, the dominant one first.

### Desert features {#sec-a1-835}

Coarse fragments that are constantly exposed to wind-blown sand may be affected by abrasion, etching and polishing, which results in even surfaces with sharp edges. These fragments are called ventifacts (windkanters), and their totality is called desert pavement. Observe an area of 5 m x 5 m with the profile at its centre and report the percentage of ventifacts out of the coarse fragments \> 2 cm (greatest dimension).

Coarse fragments may show chemical weathering, which may lead to the formation of oxides and an intense colour at their upper surfaces, whereas there is no such weathering and therefore the original rock colour at their lower surfaces. This intense colour at the upper surfaces is called desert varnish. Observe an area of 5 m x 5 m with the profile at its centre and report the percentage of coarse fragments \> 2 cm (greatest dimension) featuring desert varnish.

### Patterned ground {#sec-a1-836}

Patterned ground is the result of material sorting due to freeze-thaw cycles in permafrost regions. Report the sorting of coarse fragments \> 6 cm (greatest dimension) at the soil surface.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-a1812

            locations = cells_body(columns = 2)) 
  
tbl_a1812
```

### Surface crusts {#sec-a1-837}

Surface crusts are described as layers in [Chapter 8.4.31](#sec-a1-8431) and further explained there. The area covered is described here. Observe an area (5 m x 5 m if possible) with the profile at its centre. Report the percentage of the area that has a surface crust.

### Surface cracks {#sec-a1-838}

Cracks are fissures other than those attributed to soil structure (see [Chapter 8.4.10](#sec-a1-8410)). If surface cracks are present, report the average width of the cracks. If the soil surface between cracks of larger width classes is regularly divided by cracks of smaller width classes, report the two width classes. If different width classes occur randomly, just report the dominant one. The continuity of cracks to a greater depth is reported with the layer description (see [Chapter 8.4.13](#sec-a1-8413)). For every width class, report the average distance between the cracks and the spatial arrangement and persistence of the cracks.

## Description of layers {#sec-a1-84}

### Identification of layers and layer depths {#sec-a1-841}

A **soil layer** is a zone in the soil, approximately parallel to the soil surface, with properties different from layers above and/or below it. If at least one of these properties is the result of soil-forming processes, the layer is called a **soil horizon**. In the following, the term 'layer' is preferred to include layers, in which soilforming processes did not occur.

A soil layer is identified by certain observable characteristics. Among these characteristics are:

-   Matrix colour
-   Redoximorphic features
-   Texture
-   Coarse fragments
-   Artefacts
-   Bulk density
-   Structure
-   Coatings and bridges
-   Cracks
-   Carbonates
-   Secondary carbonates
-   Secondary gypsum
-   Secondary silica
-   Cementation
-   Water saturation
-   Volcanic glasses
-   C~org~ content
-   Human alterations

Wherever you observe a major difference in at least one of these characteristics, set a layer boundary. Whenever a layer is too thick (e.g. \> 30 cm), it may be wise to subdivide it into two or more layers of more or less equal thickness for description. In certain soils, it may also be wise to add additional layer limits at depths, which you may need to check for the presence or absence of a diagnostic horizon (e.g. 20 cm to check mollic or umbric horizons). Alluvial sediments and tephra layers may be finely stratified. It may be appropriate to combine several such strata to one layer for description. In all other cases, different geological strata must not be combined to one layer.

In the following headings, the (o), the (m), and the (o, m) indicate, whether the described characteristic has to be reported in organic or in mineral layers or in both (see [Chapter 8.4.4](#sec-a1-844)). For organotechnic layers, the user decides, which characteristics have to be described. The asterisk (\*) informs that the characteristic can also be reported in a *Pürckhauer* auger.

The layers are numbered consecutively from the soil surface (see [Chapter 8.3.1](#sec-a1-831)) downwards. Report the upper and lower depth for every layer. If the lower depth of the last layer is unknown, report the depth of the profile with the + symbol as the layer's lower depth.

The following principles have to be considered for description (see General rules, [Chapter 2.1](chapter-02.qmd#sec-gnrl)):

1.  All data refer to the fine earth, unless stated otherwise. The fine earth comprises the soil constituents ≤ 2 mm. The whole soil comprises fine earth, coarse fragments, artefacts and dead plant remnants of any size. These rules also apply to cemented layers.
2.  All data are given by mass, unless stated otherwise.

### Homogeneity of the layer (o, m) {#sec-a1-842}

#### Layer consisting of different parts {#sec-a1-842-p}

If a layer consists of two or more different parts that do not form horizontal layers but can easily be distinguished, describe them separately. Use separate lines in the Soil Description Sheet (Annex 4, [Chapter 11](annex-04-soil-description-sheet.qmd)) and report the percentage (by exposed area, related to the whole soil) of each part. Examples are layers with retic properties (see [Chapter 8.4.18](#sec-a1-8418)), with cryogenic alteration (see [Chapter 8.4.34](#sec-a1-8434)) or with remodelling by single ploughing (see [Chapter 8.4.39](#sec-a1-8439)). The separation is not recommended, if there is just a wavy boundary (as typical, e.g., for chernic horizons or for eluvial horizons in Podzols, see [Chapter 8.4.5](#sec-a1-845)) or if there are just some additions of materials (see [Chapter 8.4.39](#sec-a1-8439)).

#### Layer composed of several strata of alluvial sediments or of tephra {#sec-a1-842-s}

Alluvial strata comprise fluviatile, lacustrine and marine deposits. Tephra strata have a significant amount of pyroclasts. Report the presence of alluvial strata and of tephra strata within the described layer.

### Organic, organotechnic and mineral layers {#sec-a1-844}

We distinguish the following layers (see [Chapter 3.3](chapter-03.qmd#sec-diagm)):

-   Organic layers consist of organic material.
-   Organotechnic layers consist of organotechnic material.
-   Mineral layers are all other layers.

An organic or organotechnic layer is called hydromorphic, if water saturation lasts ≥ 30 consecutive days in most years or if it has been drained. Otherwise, it is called terrestrial. Hydromorphic organic layers comprise peat and organic limnic material. Report, whether a layer is organic, organotechnic or mineral and, if organic or organotechnic, whether it is hydromorphic or terrestrial. The distinction is preliminary and may have to be corrected according to laboratory analyses.

### Coarse fragments (o, m) {#sec-a1-847}

A coarse fragment is a mineral particle \> 2 mm in its equivalent diameter (see [Chapter 8.4.9](#sec-a1-849)). The subdivision of coarse fragments (0.6 to 60 cm) is according to their greatest dimension. This Chapter refers to natural coarse fragments. Artefacts are described in [Chapter 8.4.8](#sec-a1-848). Fragments of broken-up cemented layers are reported here together with the coarse fragments. In addition, the cementing agent has to be reported (see [Chapters 8.4.30](#sec-a1-8430) and [8.4.32](#sec-a1-8432)) (the term 'oxides' includes hydroxides and oxide-hydroxides).

#### Abundance (by volume) {#sec-a1-848-a}

Report the total percentage of the volume (related to the whole soil) occupied by solid artefacts. In addition, report at least one and up to five types and size classes and the percentage of the volume that is occupied by the respective type and size class, the dominant one first. @fig-a1-812 helps with the estimation of the volume. Black carbon has to be additionally reported as percentage of the exposed area (related to the fine earth plus black carbon of any size).

The particle size classes up to 2 mm are defined according to the equivalent diameter. The equivalent diameter is the diameter of a sphere that in sedimentation analysis sinks with the same velocity as the respective particle.

The human eye and the tactile sense of the fingers can detect particles \> 150-300 μm, depending on individual sensitivity.

#### Texture classes {#sec-a1-849-t}

Report the texture class. Please note that the hand-texturing according to the following flow chart only provides an estimation of the texture. Especially around the limits between the classes, the results might be not absolutely reliable. Beginners should ask experienced soil scientists for help.

#### Subclasses of the texture classes sand and loamy sand {#sec-a1-849-s}

If the layer belongs to the texture classes sand or loamy sand, report the subclass. The particle-size subclasses of sand are detected by visual estimation of the diameters of the grains or by laboratory analysis. The texture subclasses very fine sand and loamy very fine sand tend to feel floury, whereas all the coarser subclasses feel grainy.

### Structure (m) {#sec-a1-8410}

Structure is the spatial arrangement of soil constituents and pores. If this is, at least partially, the result of soil-forming processes, it is called **soil structure**. Otherwise, it is **rock structure**. Structure refers to the fine earth. Structure is reported for mineral layers. Additionally, structure is reported for drained hydromorphic organic layers.

A **soil aggregate** is a discrete structural body that can be clearly distinguished from its surroundings and that results from soil-forming processes. If a force is applied to a specimen, and the specimen breaks along natural surfaces of weakness, it is composed of aggregates. If the specimen breaks exactly where force is applied, the structure is **massive** (coherent). If there is no coherence between the particles, the structure is of **single-grain** type. Human disturbance may create artificial structural elements, which are called **clods**.

Undisturbed aggregates or non-aggregated structure are called the first-level structure. Aggregates of the types subangular blocky, angular blocky, polyhedral, lenticular, platy, wedge-shaped, prismatic, and columnar may break into aggregates of a second-level structure and even further into aggregates of a third-level structure. The second-level and the third-level structure may be of the same type(s) as the first-level structure or of a different one.

Use the spade, take out a large sample, make sure that the aggregates of the first-level structure, if present, are undisturbed, and observe the structure. Report the type, if present, up to three, the dominant one first. For each type, report separately grade, penetrability for roots, and size class. If applicable, report two size classes, the dominant one first. Report for every type and size class the abundance (as percentage by volume of the layer).

From the first-level structure, take some specimens from each type (if more than one size class of a type is present, take only the greater one) and try to break them with low forces. If aggregates of a second-level structure appear, report the type, if present, up to two, the dominant one first. For each type, report separately grade, size class, and penetrability for roots. If applicable, report two size classes, the dominant one first. Report for every type and size class the abundance (as percentage by volume of the respective first level structure).

From the second-level structure, take some specimens from each type (if more than one size class of a type is present, take only the greater one) and try to break them with low forces. If aggregates of a third-level structure appear, report type, grade, size class, and penetrability for roots. If applicable, report two size classes, the dominant one first. Report for every size class the abundance (as percentage by volume of the respective second level structure).

#### Inclination of wedge-shaped aggregates {#sec-a1-8410-i}

If wedge-shaped aggregates are present, report the volume (as percentage), occupied by wedge-shaped aggregates tilted between ≥ 10° and ≤ 60° from the horizontal.

### Pores and cracks (overview) {#sec-a1-8411}

Soil has air- or water-filled voids, which are:

-   Interstitial (primary packing voids)
-   Non-matrix pores (tubular, dendritic tubular, vesicular, irregular)
-   Interstructural (fractures between soil aggregates, which can be inferred from soil structure description)
-   Cracks (fissures other than those attributed to soil structure). We only report non-matrix pores and cracks.

Report all non-matrix pore types that apply. For every type and every size class, count the number of pores in the assessed area. For every type, report the dominant size class (size class that has the highest number of pores). For every type, calculate the sum of pores across the size classes and report the abundance class.

Example:

Very fine: 0\
Fine: 2\
Medium: 2\
Coarse: 1\
Very coarse: 0

The sum is 5, and the abundance class is Common.

#### Width and abundance {#sec-a1-8413-w}

Report the average width in mm and the number of cracks. Count the cracks across 1 m horizontally; use the vertical centre of the layer.

### Stress features (m) {#sec-a1-8414}

Stress features result from soil aggregates that are pressed against each other due to swelling clays. The aggregate surfaces may be shiny. There are two types: Pressure faces do not slide past each other and have no striations, slickensides slide past each other and have striations. Striations develop if sand (or silt) grains are moved with strong pressure along the aggregate surfaces. Stress features do not differ in colour from the matrix (see [Chapter 8.4.17](#sec-a1-8417)). A hand lens (maximum 10x) may be helpful. Report the abundance of

-   Pressure faces in % of the surfaces of soil aggregates
-   Slickensides in % of the surfaces of soil aggregates.

### Soil colour (overview) {#sec-a1-8416}

In general, soil colour can be a property of the four following soil features:

-   Matrix (see [Chapter 8.4.17](#sec-a1-8417) and [Chapter 8.4.18](#sec-a1-8418))
-   Lithogenic variegates (see [Chapter 8.4.19](#sec-a1-8419))
-   Redoximorphic features, resulting from redox processes (see [Chapter 8.4.20](#sec-a1-8420))
-   Non-redoximorphic features, resulting from other pedogenic processes:
    -   initial weathering (see [Chapter 8.4.22](#sec-a1-8422))
    -   clay coatings and bridges (see [Chapter 8.4.23](#sec-a1-8423))
    -   uncoated sand and/or coarse silt grains (see [Chapter 8.4.23](#sec-a1-8423))
    -   ribbon-like accumulations (see [Chapter 8.4.24](#sec-a1-8424))
    -   secondary carbonates (see [Chapter 8.4.25](#sec-a1-8425))
    -   secondary gypsum (see [Chapter 8.4.26](#sec-a1-8426))
    -   secondary silica (see [Chapter 8.4.27](#sec-a1-8427))
    -   readily soluble salts (see [Chapter 8.4.28](#sec-a1-8428))
    -   accumulations of organic matter (see [Chapter 8.4.36](#sec-a1-8436))

Use the Munsell Color Charts. Take a fresh sample, slightly crush it and observe the colour in the shade (both your eyes and the colour chart in the shade) and not in the twilight. Report hue, value and chroma. The matrix colour is recorded twice, moist and (if possible) dry, the other colours only in the moist state. The moist state corresponds to field capacity, which is obtained with sufficient accuracy by moistening and reading the colour as soon as visible moisture films have disappeared.

### Matrix colour (m) (\*) {#sec-a1-8417}

Report the colour of the soil matrix. If there is more than one matrix colour, report up to three, the dominant one first, and give the percentage of the exposed area.

Advanced chemical weathering without physical alteration, especially without turbation, results in saprolite (see [Chapter 8.4.10](#sec-a1-8410)). According to the minerals present, a colour pattern may result. These colours are reported as matrix colours.

### Combinations of darker-coloured finer-textured and lighter-coloured coarser-textured parts (m) {#sec-a1-8418}

If a layer consists of darker-coloured finer-textured and lighter-coloured coarser-textured parts that do not form horizontal layers but can easily be distinguished, describe them separately. Use separate lines in the Soil Description Sheet (Annex 4, [Chapter 11](annex-04-soil-description-sheet.qmd)) and give a full description. The principal colours are regarded to be matrix colours.

For the coarser-textured parts, report in addition the following characteristics:

-   the percentage (by exposed area) occupied by coarser-textured parts of any orientation (vertical, horizontal, inclined) having a width of ≥ 0.5 cm
-   the percentage (by exposed area) occupied by continuous vertical tongues of coarser-textured parts with a horizontal extension of ≥ 1 cm (if these tongues are absent, report 0%)
-   the depth range, where these tongues cover ≥ 10% of the exposed area (if they extend across serveral layers, the length is only reported in the description of that layer, where they start at the layer's upper limit).

In the middle of the layer, prepare a horizontal surface, 50 cm x 50 cm, and report the percentage (by horizontal area covered) of the coarser-textured parts.

### Lithogenic variegates (m) {#fig-a1-8419}

Report colour, size, and abundance. If more than one colour occurs, report up to three, the dominant one first, and give size and abundance for each colour separately.

#### Colour {#fig-a1-8419-c}

Report the colour according to the Munsell Color Charts. Write 'None' if there are no lithogenic variegates.

#### Size {#fig-a1-8419-s}

The Table indicates the average length of the greatest dimension.

```

#### Abundance (by exposed area) {#fig-a1-8419-a}

Report the percentage of abundance.

### Redoximorphic features (m) {#sec-a1-8420}

Redoximorphic features (oximorphic features plus reductimorphic features) are the result of redox processes. Oximorphic features show the accumulation of substances in oxidized state and usually a redder hue, a higher chroma and a lower value than the surrounding material, while reductimorphic features show the opposite characteristics. Soil parts showing reductimorphic features may either contain substances in reduced state or may have lost them.

Report substance, location, size (up to two, the dominant one first), cementation class and abundance for each colour separately, for up to three colours, the dominant one first. Substance for oximorphic features is always reported, for reductimorphic features only in some cases. Size is only reported for oximorphic features inside soil aggregates. Cementation is only reported for oximorphic features. The abundance is reported as percentage of the exposed area.

#### Colour (\*) {#sec-a1-8420-c}

Report the colour according to the Munsell Color Charts. Write 'None' if there are no redoximorphic features.

#### Abundance (by exposed area) {#sec-a1-8420-aa}

Report the total abundance of the parts with oximorphic features and the total abundance of the parts with reductimorphic features, both for inner, outer and random locations, separately. Report them as percentage of the exposed area.

#### Abundance of cemented oximorphic features (by volume, related to the whole soil) {#sec-a1-8420-av}

This paragraph refers to cemented oximorphic features with a cementation class of at least moderately cemented and a diameter of \> 2 mm. They comprise concretions and nodules (see above) and fragments of a broken-up layer that has been cemented by Fe oxides. Report the abundance.

### Redox potential and reducing conditions (o, m) {#sec-a1-8421}

The soil redox potential (Eh) expresses the ratio of the concentrations of oxidized and reduced substances and is measured in millivolts (mV). In soils, redox potentials range from +800 mV to --350 mV. A low redox potential indicates strong reducing conditions. When opening a profile pit, oxygen gets access to the profile wall, which leads to a rapid oxidation of the exposed reduced substances and to a subsequent change of the redox potential at the profile wall.

#### Measure the redox potential and calculate the rH value {#sec-a1-8421-m}

For measuring the redox potential [@blume2010; @un-fao2006], the following equipment is needed:

-   a pointed stainless-steel rod of 4-5 mm in diameter, long enough to reach the desired soil depth
-   a perforated plastic tube of 15-20 mm in diameter and of a length corresponding to the depth of measurement
-   concentrated KCl solution, fixed with agar
-   a Pt electrode
-   a reference electrode, e.g., with Ag/AgCl in 1 *M* KCl or with calomel (as used for measuring the pH value)
-   a potentiometer.

Procedure: Step 1 - 2 m aside the profile pit and drive the rod into the soil down to the desired depth, roughen the Pt electrode with fine-grained sandpaper, intrude it immediately into the hole and press it against the soil. Make another hole at 10-20 cm distance, wide and deep enough to place a plastic tube that is some cm longer than the depth of the Pt electrode. Fill the tube with the fixed KCl solution, place the tube into the hole and fix it with soil material. Then, place the reference electrode into the KCl solution. Connect the electrodes with the potentiometer and read the voltage after 30 minutes. Repeat readings every 10 minutes until the value is stable. In some cases, this may take several hours. At least two replicates are recommended. (If you dispose of more than one set of equipment, you may measure the redox potential simultaneously at different soil depths.) The obtained voltage has to be adjusted to the voltage of the standard hydrogen electrode: for Ag/AgCl in 1 *M* KCl add +244 mV, for calomel add +287 mV. Simultaneously, measure the pH value (see [Chapter 8.4.29](#sec-a1-8429)) of the soil at the profile wall in distilled water (soil:water = 1:5) at the same depth. Report the rH value that is calculated with the following equation: rH = (2 Eh/59) + 2 pH

Note: If the profile is freshly dug and not too sandy, you may also place the electrodes horizontally at least 15 cm behind in the profile wall.

#### Estimate the rH value (\*) {#sec-a1-8421-e}

The following field tests are available to prove reducing conditions:

-   Methane can be lit with a match.
-   H~2~S is formed when spraying a soil sample with a 10% HCl solution and can be identified by the odour of rotten eggs.
-   Fe^2+^ can be proven by oxidation with a 0.2% (mass by volume) solution of α,α-dipyridyl dissolved in 1 *N* ammonium acetate (NH~4~OAc), pH 7. Take a soil sample and spray it with the solution. If Fe^2+^ is present, a strong red colour will develop. The test needs a freshly broken sample that has not yet been oxidized at the open profile wall. In neutral to alkaline soils, the colour is hardly visible. Caution: The solution is slightly toxic.

The following Table explains how to estimate the rH value using these field tests and the observed redoximorphic features (see [Chapter 8.4.20](#sec-a1-8420)). Report the rH range. Note that oximorphic features may be relic. Reductimorphic features may also be relic, if Fe and Mn have been removed in reduced form leaving behind a layer virtually free of Fe and Mn.

### Initial weathering (m) {#sec-a1-8422}

A major process of chemical weathering is the formation of Fe oxides (including hydroxides and oxide-hydroxides). If the weathering is initial, the Fe oxides may be concentrated in soil parts with easy access to oxygen, e.g. along pores. These parts have a distinctly redder hue or stronger chroma. Report the abundance as percentage of the exposed area.

### Coatings and bridges (m) {#sec-a1-8423}

#### Clay coatings and clay bridges {#sec-a1-8423-c}

Illuviated clay consists of clay minerals, mostly together with oxides and in many cases together with organic matter. It covers surfaces of soil aggregates, coarse fragments and biopore walls as coatings (argillans), or it forms bridges between sand grains. The clay minerals give the coatings a shiny appearance. The oxides provide a colour that is more intensive (usually a higher Munsell chroma) than the colour of the matrix; organic matter provides a darker colour (usually a lower Munsell value) than the colour of the matrix (see Chapter 8.4.17). A hand lens (maximum 10x) may be helpful.

Report the abundance of

-   clay coatings in % of the surfaces of soil aggregates, coarse fragments and/or biopore walls
-   clay bridges between sand grains in % of involved sand grains.

#### Organic matter coatings and oxide coatings on sand and coarse silt grains {#sec-a1-8423-o}

Sand and coarse silt grains are mostly coated by organic matter and/or oxides. In certain layers, these coatings may be cracked. In other layers, these coatings may be missing.

For C, report the percentage related to the estimated number of sand grains. For U, report the percentage related to the estimated number of sand and coarse silt grains.

### Ribbon-like accumulations (m) (\*) {#sec-a1-8424}

Ribbon-like accumulations are thin, horizontally continuous accumulations within the matrix of another layer. Report the accumulated substance(s).

The term 'oxides', as used here, includes hydroxides and oxide-hydroxides. If clay minerals are accumulated, a ribbon-like accumulation is \< 7.5 cm thick, in all other cases \< 2.5 cm. If there are 2 or more ribbon-like accumulations in one layer, report the number of the accumulations and their combined thickness in cm. If clay minerals are accumulated (CC, CO, CH, TO), the ribbon-like accumulations are called **lamellae**.

### Carbonates (o, m) {#sec-a1-8425}

Take a soil sample, add drops of 1 *M* HCl and observe the reaction. This method detects primary and secondary calcium carbonates. Contrary to calcium carbonate, dolomite (calcium magnesium carbonate) shows little reaction with cold HCl. To identity dolomite, put some soil material in a spoon, add drops of 1 *M* HCl and heat it with a lighter underneath. If effervescence occurs only after heating, the presence of dolomite is indicated.

#### Content (\*) {#sec-a1-8425-c}

Report the carbonate content in the soil matrix and report, whether the reaction with HCl is immediate or only after heating.

### Gypsum (m) {#sec-a1-8426}

#### Content {#sec-a1-8426-c}

Report the gypsum content in the soil matrix. If readily soluble salts are absent or present in small amounts only, gypsum can be estimated by measuring the electrical conductivity in soil suspensions of different soil-water relations after 30 minutes (in the case of fine-grained gypsum). This method detects primary and secondary gypsum. Note: Higher gypsum contents may be differentiated by abundance of H~2~O-soluble pseudomycelia/crystals and a soil colour with high value and low chroma.

#### Secondary gypsum {#sec-a1-8426-2}

Secondary gypsum may be found as

-   filaments (vermiform gypsum, pseudomycelia)
-   gypsum crystal intergrowths or nodules (roses)
-   pendants (normally fibrous) below coarse fragments or cemented fragments
-   fibrous aggregates
-   flour-like gypsum.

Gypsum is soft and can easily be ripped with a knife or broken between thumbnail and forefinger. Gypsum is very soluble, and when gypsum is found in soils that are not in extremely arid conditions, it can be assumed that it is secondary in almost all cases. Contrary to that, gypsiferous rocks and their fragments are primary. Fibrous gypsum, when occurring along veins within limestones or sandstones is also primary. Report the total abundance (as percentage by exposed area, related to the fine earth plus accumulations of secondary gypsum of any size and any cementation class) of all types of secondary gypsum.

### Secondary silica (m) {#sec-a1-8427}

#### Form {#sec-a1-8427-f}

Secondary silica (SiO~2~) is off-white and predominantly consisting of opal and microcrystalline forms. It occurs as laminar caps, lenses, (partly) filled interstices, bridges between sand grains, and as coatings at surfaces of soil aggregates, biopore walls, coarse fragments, and cemented fragments. Report the type of secondary silica. If more than one type occurs, report up to two, the dominant one first. Note: Durinodes are often coated with secondary carbonates.

#### Abundance {#sec-a1-8427-a}

Report the total percentage (by exposed area) of secondary silica. For a cemented layer, this percentage refers to the fine earth plus accumulations of secondary silica of any size and any cementation class. For durinodes and fragments of a cemented layer, this percentage comprises the secondary silica visible at their surfaces. If a layer shows durinodes and/or fragments of a cemented layer, report in addition the percentage (by volume) of those durinodes and fragments that have a diameter ≥ 1 cm.

### Readily soluble salts (o, m) {#sec-a1-8428}

Readily soluble salts are precipitated in dry soil and dissolved in moist soil. They are more soluble than gypsum. The presence of readily soluble salts is checked by measuring the electrical conductivity in the saturation extract (EC~SE~). In the saturation extract, the soil is completely moist, but has no visible water surplus. This is not easy to achieve.

Alternatively, one can measure the electrical conductivity in an extract of 10 g soil with 25 ml aqua dest. (EC~2.5~). Mix soil and water carefully, let it rest for at least 30 minutes and measure the electrical conductivity in the clear solution in dS m^-1^. It must then be transformed into the EC~SE~ according to the following equation: EC~SE~ = 250 x EC~2.5~ x (WC~SE~)^-1^.

WC~SE~ is the water content in the saturation extract. It can be estimated in mineral soils from texture (see [Chapter 8.4.9](#sec-a1-849)) and C~org~ content (see [Chapter 8.4.36](#sec-a1-8436)) and in peat soils from the degree of decomposition (see [Chapter 8.4.41](#sec-a1-8441)) with the help of the following Tables. High amounts of coarse fragments reduce the water content.

Report the electrical conductivity of the saturation extract in dS m^-1^.

### Field pH (o, m) {#sec-a1-8429}

Report the field pH. For its determination, two different methods are recommended: the colorimetric and the potentiometric method. The colorimetric method only allows the pH measurement in distilled water, while the potentiometric method allows the measurement in different solutions.

#### Colorimetric method {#sec-a1-8429-c}

Mix soil and distilled water in a 1:1 ratio (volume:volume) and stir the mixture thoroughly. Allow the mixture to settle until a supernatant forms. Submerge an indicator paper in the supernatant and report the result.

#### Potentiometric method {#sec-a1-8429-p}

@tbl-a1871 shows common solutions and mixing ratios. Mix air-dry soil with the solution thoroughly. Allow the mixture to settle until a supernatant forms. Measure the pH value with a pH electrode, ideally with the help of a tripod. Wait until the measured value is steady. Report the measured value together with the code indicating solution and mixing ratio.

### Consistence (m) {#sec-a1-8430}

Consistence is the degree and kind of cohesion and adhesion that soil exhibits. This Chapter refers to the consistence of the matrix and of non-redoximorphic features. For the consistence of redoximorphic features, see [Chapter 8.4.20](#sec-a1-8420). Consistence is reported separately for cemented and non-cemented (parts of) layers. If a specimen of soil does not fall into pieces by applying low forces, one has to check, whether it is cemented.

#### Presence and volume of cementation {#sec-a1-8430-p}

For checking cementation, different specimens have to be taken, depending on soil characteristics. For checking surface crusts and platy aggregates, take a specimen that is approximately 1 to 1.5 cm long by 0.5 cm thick (or the thickness of occurrence, if \< 0.5 cm thick). In all other cases, take a specimen, around 2.6 to 3 cm long at all dimensions. Take the specimen air-dried and submerge it in water for at least 1 hour. If it slakes like forming a soup, it is not cemented. Otherwise, it is cemented. Report the percentage (by volume, related to the whole soil) of the layer that is cemented.

#### Cementing agents (cemented soil) {#sec-a1-8430-c}

Report the cementing agents. If more than one is present, report up to three, the dominant one first. The term 'oxides', as used here, includes hydroxides and oxide-hydroxides.

#### Cementation (cemented soil) and rupture resistance (non-cemented soil) {#sec-a1-8430-r}

For checking this feature, different specimens have to be taken, depending on soil characteristics. For checking surface crusts and platy aggregates, take a specimen that is approximately 1 to 1.5 cm long by 0.5 cm thick (or the thickness of occurrence, if \< 0.5 cm thick) and apply force perpendicular to its greatest dimension. In all other cases, take a specimen, around 2.6 to 3 cm long at all dimensions, and apply force. Observe the force needed for failure and report the cementation class (cemented soil) or the rupture resistance class (non-cemented soil). The rupture resistance has to be detected in moist soil and, if possible, also in dry soil. If specimens of the required size are not obtainable, use the following equation to calculate the stress at failure (@tbl-a1873 and @tbl-a1874) [@schoeneberger2012]:

(2.8 cm/cube length cm)^2^ x (estimated stress (N) at failure)

e.g. for a 5.6-cm cube \[(2.8/5.6)^2^ x 20 N\] = 5 N → Very friable (moist).

#### Plasticity (non-cemented soil) {#sec-a1-8430-l}

#### Penetration resistance

Measuring the penetration resistance is recommended for layers that are cemented or have a rupture-resistance class of firm or more (moist). Non-cemented soil should be at field capacity for measurement. Use a penetrometer and report the penetration resistance in MPa. The measurement should be repeated at least five times to calculate a reliable average value.

### Surface crusts (m) {#sec-a1-8431}

A crust is a thin layer of soil constituents bound together into a horizontal mat or into small polygonal plates [see @schoeneberger2012]. Soil crusts develop in the first mineral layer(s) and are formed by a sealing agent of physical, chemical and/or biological origin. The characteristics of the crust are different from the underlying layers. Typically, soil crusts change the infiltration rate and stabilize loose soil aggregates. They may be present permanently or only when the soil is dry. The area covered is reported in [Chapter 8.3.7](#sec-a1-837). They may be cemented or not, which is reported in [Chapter 8.4.30](#sec-a1-8430).

Report the sealing agent. If more than one is present, report up to three, the dominant one first.

### Continuity of hard materials and cemented layers (m) {#sec-a1-8432}

Continuous rock, technic hard material and cemented layers may have fractures, which are filled by non-cemented soil material. Report the average distance between the fractures in cm and the total percentage (by volume, related to the whole soil) that is occupied by the fractures. This has also to be reported, if the hard or cemented material starts at the soil surface. If the layer is broken up, the fragments are reported with the coarse fragments (see [Chapter 8.4.7](#sec-a1-847)).

### Volcanic glasses and andic characteristics (o, m) {#sec-a1-8433}

#### Volcanic glasses in the sand and coarse silt fraction {#sec-a1-8433-s}

```

If the percentage is around a limit value, take a soil sample, gain the sand and coarse silt fraction by sieving, lay the particles on a sheet, and count the glass particles and the non-glass particles.

#### Andic characteristics {#sec-a1-8433-a}

Andic properties are defined by laboratory data. In the field, one can recognize a low bulk density, a dark colour and a high organic matter content. In addition, there are two specific field tests indicative of andic properties.

Thixotropy: Layers with andic properties show a high variable charge allowing the absorption of much water that can easily be driven out by shaking but will be absorbed again, after a while. Procedure: Take a soil sample and make a sphere of about 2.5 cm in diameter. Wait until any moisture films have disappeared. Place the sphere in cupped hands and shake it. If moisture films appear at the surface of the sphere, the soil shows thixotropy. After a while, the moisture films will disappear again.

NaF test according to Fieldes and Perrott [-@fieldes1966], after FAO [-@un-fao2006]: A pH~NaF~ of \> 9.5 indicates the presence of abundant allophanes and imogolites and/or organo-aluminium complexes. Aluminium sorbs F^-^ ions while releasing OH^-^ ions. The test is indicative for most layers with andic properties, except for those very rich in organic matter. However, the same reaction occurs in spodic horizons and in acidic clayey soils that are rich in aluminium-interlayered clay minerals; soils with free carbonates also react. Before applying the NaF test, check the soil pH in water or KCl (the NaF test is not suitable for alkaline soils) and the presence of free carbonates (using the HCl test). Procedure: Place a small amount of soil on a filter paper previously soaked in phenolphthalein and add some drops of 1 M NaF (adjusted to pH 7.5). A positive reaction is indicated by a fast change to an intense red colour. Alternatively, measure the pH of a suspension of 1 g soil in 50 ml 1 M NaF (adjusted to pH 7.5) after waiting 2 minutes. A pH of \> 9.5 is an indication of andic properties.

Report the results.

With the following Figure, the bulk density is determined from packing density and soil texture (see [Chapter 8.4.9](#sec-a1-849)). If C~org~ content is \> 1%, bulk density must be reduced by 0.03 kg dm^-3^ for each 0.5% increment in C~org~ content. Report the bulk density with an accuracy of one decimal.

### Soil organic carbon (C~org~) (m) {#sec-a1-8436}

#### Estimation of the content (\*) {#sec-a1-8436-e}

Report the estimated organic carbon content. It is based on the Munsell value, moist, and the texture. If chroma is 3.5 - 6, use value 0.5 higher (e.g. if you reported a Munsell colour of 10YR 3/4, use a value of 3.5 for estimating soil organic carbon). If chroma is \> 6, use value 1 higher.

Caution: The Munsell value is also influenced by parent material, carbonates and redox conditions.

#### Natural accumulations of organic matter {#sec-a1-8436-n}

This Chapter refers to accumulations of organic matter in form of discrete bodies. They have usually a lower value than the surrounding material. Report here all accumulations that are natural or that are a side effect of human activities. Additions of artefacts see [Chapter 8.4.8](#sec-a1-848) and of human-transported material see [Chapter 8.4.39](#sec-a1-8439). If black carbon is purposefully made by humans, it is considered to be an artefact. Organic matter accumulations due to animal activity are reported twice, once here and once in [Chapter 8.4.38](#sec-a1-8438).

tbl_a1892_dat <- tribble(
  ~Criterion, ~Type, ~Code,
  'Breaks into longitudinal pieces with sharp edges',   'Sharp-edged', 'SE',
  'Breaks into longitudinal pieces with unsharp edges', 'Compact',     'CO',
  'Breaks into crumbly pieces or breaks powdery',       'Crumbly',     'CR')

#### Dead natural plant remnants {#sec-a1-8441-n}

This Chapter refers to dead natural plant remnants of any length and a diameter ≥ 5 mm. For treated plant remnants, see artefacts (see [Chapter 8.4.8](#sec-a1-848)). Report up to two types of plant remnants, the dominant one first, and give the percentage (by volume, related to the fine earth plus all dead plant remnants) for each type separately.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-a1893
#| tbl-cap: Dead remnants of specific plants
#| tbl-colwidths: [80, 20] 

tbl_a1893_dat <- tribble(
  ~Type, ~Code,
'Wood',                   'W',
'Moss fibres',            'S',
'Other plants',           'O',
'No dead plant remnants', 'N')

## Sampling {#sec-a1-85}

We describe here the sampling of the terrestrial organic surface layers and the conventional and volumetric sampling of mineral layers, all for the standard analyses described in Annex 2 ([Chapter 9](annex-02-analytical-procedures.qmd)). Sampling of other layers requires special techniques that are not described here.

### Preparation of sampling bags {#sec-a1-851}

Use strong, moisture-resistant bags (transparent, if possible) for sampling. Write the sampling details twice: once on the bag and once on a piece of paper to be put into the bag. If you want to transfer sampling rings to the laboratory, write the sampling details on the ring. Always use a permanent marker.

Write down the following details:

-   Profile name
-   Conventional (C) / Volumetric (V)
-   Layer upper and lower depth
-   Layer designation (see Annex 3, Chapter 10).

Example: *Gombori Pass 1 - V - 0-10 cm - Ah.*

Make sure to seal the bags after filling in the sample.

### Sampling of terrestrial organic surface layers {#sec-a1-852}

For the terrestrial organic surface layers, use a quadratic steel frame, for instance with 30 cm side length. Use a rubber hammer to drive the frame through the organic surface layers and a few centimetres into the mineral soil. The frame must enter the soil evenly, do not drive in one side first and then the other. Collect the organic surface material manually, sample the litter layer and the O horizons separately. Be very careful to sample all organic surface material but no mineral soil.

### Conventional sampling of mineral layers {#sec-a1-853}

Use a scraper to sample every layer separately and along its entire height and width. Start with the lowest layer. Make sure that you only sample one layer at a time, avoid that material from one layer falls into the other.

### Volumetric sampling of mineral layers {#sec-a1-854}

At the soil surface, determine an area large enough for the appropriate number of sampling rings (e.g. 3 rings). The area must be adjacent to the profile wall and close to the measuring tape. In this area, remove the organic surface layers and start sampling layer by layer from top to down. The thickness of a mineral layer may be larger or smaller than the height of a sampling ring or it may be equal (@fig-a1-822).

![Volumetric sampling](images/figure_8-22.png){#fig-a1-822}

a.  If the thickness of the layer is larger, subtract the height of the sampling ring from the layer thickness and divide the difference by 2. This result equals the thickness of soil material that has to be removed starting from the upper layer boundary.
b.  If the thickness of the layer is equal, it is very important that the surface is plane.
c.  If the thickness of the layer is smaller, you will need the thickness of the layer in relation to the height of the sampling ring for calculating the sampled volume.

For each layer, form a plane surface. If the soil is dryer than field capacity, moisten the surface slowly with water from a spray bottle. Wait until the soil is moist, avoid a water surplus. Then drive in the sampling rings slowly and completely but avoid compacting soil material. For driving in the sampling rings, use a hammer and a piece of wood. The piece should be made of durable wood and have plane surfaces at the top and the bottom. It should be just large enough to cover one sampling ring. If the ring does not move in without deforming, stop driving it in. Try to find a better position.

To take out the rings, penetrate the soil with a spatula just beneath the ring and take it out. If the soil is hard to penetrate, you may use a knife with a serrated blade (bread knife). When necessary, cut roots off. When taking the rings out, make sure that no soil material is lost from inside the rings. Place a cap on the top side and turn the ring upside down. Now make the bottom surface plane and place another cap.

If you want to do further physical analyses, transfer the ring to the laboratory. If the layer thickness is smaller than the height of the ring (case c), fill up the volume with a resin. If you just want to determine the soil mass, you may empty the soil material from the ring into the designated bag and reuse the ring.

To determine the soil mass of a sample of a certain volume, you may also use coated clods (see Annex 2, [Chapter 9.5](annex-02-analytical-procedures.qmd#sec-2-bd)).
