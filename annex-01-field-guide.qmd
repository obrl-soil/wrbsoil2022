# Annex 1: Field Guide

This field guide helps describe soils. It provides all field characteristics needed for WRB classification and some other general field characteristics. This field guide is not supposed to be a comprehensive manual. People using this guide must have basic knowledge in soil science and experience in the field. In many soils, some of the listed characteristics are not present. Every characteristic must be reported in the soil description sheet (Annex 4, Chapter 11) using the provided codes.

The field guide consists of six consecutive parts:

1.  Preparation work and general rules
2.  General data and description of soil-forming factors
3.  Description of surface characteristics
4.  Description of layers
5.  Sampling
6.  References

## Preparation work and general rules

### Exploration of an area of interest with auger and spade

Select your area of interest and give it a distinct name, e.g., Gombori Pass. Then select a location. For further exploration, use a Pürckhauer or an Edelman auger. If using a Pürckhauer auger, drive it into the soil vertically with a plastic hammer. Occasionally, turn the auger with the help of the turning bar, especially in clay-rich soils. If the auger hits a rock or big stone, take it out. You may try again a small distance apart but be careful not to damage the auger. Drive the auger in to a depth of 1 m if possible. If not, note the actual depth that was reached. To take it out, turn it while pulling.

Now place the auger onto the ground. Cut the protruding soil material with a knife and remove it to the side. Avoid contaminating one layer with the removed material from another. Be aware that compaction inside the auger may have occurred; the layer depths may therefore not be accurate. Place a folding ruler aside the auger according to the actually reached depth (Figure 8.2).

In most cases, the topsoil falls out of the auger. To investigate it in more detail, always make a mini-profile close to where the auger was driven in. It should be at least 25 cm deep and wide, and the profile walls should be vertical and smooth. Now place a folding ruler inside the profile in such a way that point 0 is at the soil surface (see Chapter 8.3.1). For later reconstruction, it may help to take a picture of the mini-profile (Figure 8.3).

The characteristics that can be described from the soil material in the auger are marked with an asterisk (\*) in Chapter 8.4.

### Preparation of a soil profile

The soil profile should be at least 1 m deep or reach the parent material. On a slope, unless the parent material starts at smaller depth, the profile depth (Figure 8.4) should be 1 m / cos(α). For the decision if the thickness and depth criteria of the WRB are fulfilled and when calculating element stocks (Prietzel & Wiesmeier, 2019), the layer thickness perpendicular to the slope is needed. This is calculated multiplying the vertical thickness by cos(α).

![Correct profile depth when terrain is inclined](figure_8-4.png)

The profile should be 1 m wide. If on a slope, the profile wall must be parallel to the contour lines. The material should be piled up to the left and/or right side of the profile and must not be placed on top side of the profile (the side of the profile wall). Never walk or place tools on the side of the profile wall. It is recommended to collect the soil material on two tarps, topsoil and subsoil separately. When refilling the soil profile later, you should first fill in the subsoil and then the topsoil.

![Ideal soil profile. Always take the photo perpendicular to the profile wall](figure_8-5.png)
:::

::: {grid-col-8}
Carefully prepare the profile wall: it must be strictly vertical and smooth. Roots should be cut directly at the profile wall. Use an appropriate tool to clean the profile wall horizontally and avoid vertical smearing. Place the measuring tape in such a way that point 0 is at the soil surface (see Chapter 8.3.1). It should be at one side but not touch the side walls. It must be strictly vertical and plane. It may help to weight the bottom end of the tape with a stone or stick. Take a photo. Hold the camera perpendicularly to the profile wall (Figure 8.5). Avoid any inclination. Also take at least one picture of the surrounding terrain and vegetation (Figure 8.6), e.g., the tree canopy. Make sure you will be able to associate profile and photo later. If possible, save and name the pictures the same day they are taken.

If you describe a soil profile that has been dug some time ago, the topsoil may be disturbed. To describe the humus forms, you need a fresh miniprofile nearby the soil profile.

## General data and description of soil-forming factors

This Chapter refers to some general data and to the soil-forming factors climate, landform and vegetation. Other soil-forming factors are described with the layer description.

### Date and authors

Report the date of description and the names of the describing authors.

### Location

Give the location a name and report it; e.g., *Gombori Pass 1*.\
Report the GPS coordinates.\
Report the altitude above sea level (a.s.l.); e.g., *106 m*.

### Landform and topography

This Chapter refers to the large-scale topography. For local surface unevenness, see Chapter 8.3.11.

#### Gradient

Report the ground surface inclination with respect to the horizontal plane. If the profile lies on a flat surface, the gradient is 0%. If it lies on a slope, make 2 records, one upslope and one downslope; e.g., *upslope: 18%, downslope: 16%*.

#### Slope aspect

If the profile lies on a slope, report the compass direction that the slope faces, viewed downslope; e.g., 225°.

![Slope aspect, Schoeneberger et al. (2012), 1-5](figure_8-7.png)

#### Slope shape

If the profile lies on a slope, report the slope shape in 2 directions: up-/downslope (perpendicular to the elevation contour, i.e. the vertical curvature) and across slope (along the elevation contour, i.e. the horizontal curvature); e.g., *Linear*, *Convex* or *Concave*.

![Slope Shape, Schoeneberger et al. (2012), 1-6](figure_8-8.png)

#### Position of the soil profile (related to topography)

If the profile lies in an uneven terrain, report the profile position.

### Vegetation and land use

This Chapter refers to all kinds of plant cover from completely natural to completely human-made. It is not a vegetation survey, and only the really soil-relevant characteristics are reported. If the land is cultivated as cropland or grassland, the cultivation type is reported. In all other cases, the vegetation type is reported. Observe an area (10 m x 10 m, if possible) with the profile at its centre.

#### Vegetation strata

The following strata are relevant.

#### Vegetation type or cultivation type

If the land is not cultivated, report the vegetation type according to Table 8.8, for each stratum separately; if more than one type occurs in the same stratum, report up to three, the dominant one first. If the land is cultivated, report the cultivation type according to Table 8.9; cultivated land may show several strata, but they are not reported separately.

: Cultivation type

#### Vegetation height, cover and taxa

For non-cultivated land, report the following characteristics:

-   Report the average height and the maximum height in m above ground for each stratum separately.
-   Report the vegetation cover. For the upper stratum and the mid-stratum, report the percentage (by area) of the crown cover. For the ground stratum, report the percentage (by area) of the ground cover.
-   Report up to three important species per stratum, e.g., *Fagus orientalis*. If you do not know the species, report the next higher taxonomic rank.

#### Actual or last cultivated species

For cultivated land, report the actual cultivated species using the scientific name, e.g., *Zea mays*. If currently under fallow, report the last species and indicate month and year of harvest or of cultivation cessation. If more than one species is/was grown simultaneously, report up to three in the sequence of the area covered, starting with the species that covers the largest area; this includes tree species in simultaneous agroforestry systems.

#### Rotational cultivated species

For cultivated land, report the species that have been cultivated in the last five years in rotation with the actual or last species. Report up to three in the sequence of frequency, starting with the most frequent species; this includes tree species in rotational agroforestry systems.

#### Special techniques to enhance site productivity

Report the techniques that refer to the surrounding area of the soil profile. Techniques that affect certain soil layers are reported for the respective layer. Techniques that cause surface unevenness have to be reported in Chapter 8.3.11, additionally. If more than one type is present, report up to three, the dominant one first.

## Description of surface characteristics

Surface characteristics can be detected on the soil surface without looking into a soil profile.

### Soil surface

A **litter layer** is a loose layer that contains \> 90% (by volume, related to the fine earth plus all dead plant remnants) recognizable dead plant tissues (e.g. undecomposed leaves). Dead plant material still connected to living plants (e.g. dead parts of *Sphagnum* mosses) is not regarded to form part of a litter layer. The **soil surface** (0 cm) is by convention the surface of the soil after removing, if present, the litter layer and, if present, below a layer of living plants (e.g. living mosses). The **mineral soil surface** is the upper limit of the uppermost mineral horizon (see Chapter 2.1, General rules, and see Chapter 8.4.4).

### Litter layer

Observe an area of 5 m x 5 m with the profile at its centre. Report the average and the maximum thickness of the litter layer in cm (see Chapter 8.3.1). If there is no litter layer, report 0 cm as thickness.

### Rock outcrops

Rock outcrops are exposures of bedrock. Observe an area (10 m x 10 m if possible) with the profile at its centre. Report the percentage of the area that is covered by rock outcrops. Also report in m the average distance between rock outcrops and their size (average length of the greatest dimension).

### Coarse surface fragments

Coarse surface fragments are loose fragments lying at the soil surface, including those partially exposed. Observe an area (5 m x 5 m if possible) with the profile at its centre. The Table indicates the average length of the greatest dimension in cm.

| Size (cm)    | Size class                  | Code  |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------|
| \> 0.2\--0.6 | Fine gravel                 | **F** |
| \> 0.6 - 2   | Medium gravel               | **M** |
| \> 2 - 6     | Coarse gravel               | **C** |
| \> 6 - 20    | Stones                      | **S** |
| \> 20 - 60   | Boulders                    | **B** |
| \> 60        | Large boulders              | **L** |
|              | No coarse surface fragments | **N** |

: Size of coarse surface fragments, FAO (2006), Table 15

Report the total percentage of the area that is covered by coarse surface fragments. In addition, report at least one and up to three size classes and report the percentage of the area that is covered by the coarse surface fragments of the respective size class, the dominant one first.

### Desert features

Coarse fragments that are constantly exposed to wind-blown sand may be affected by abrasion, etching and polishing, which results in even surfaces with sharp edges. These fragments are called ventifacts (windkanters), and their totality is called desert pavement. Observe an area of 5 m x 5 m with the profile at its centre and report the percentage of ventifacts out of the coarse fragments \> 2 cm (greatest dimension).

Coarse fragments may show chemical weathering, which may lead to the formation of oxides and an intense colour at their upper surfaces, whereas there is no such weathering and therefore the original rock colour at their lower surfaces. This intense colour at the upper surfaces is called desert varnish. Observe an area of 5 m x 5 m with the profile at its centre and report the percentage of coarse fragments \> 2 cm (greatest dimension) featuring desert varnish.

### Patterned ground

Patterned ground is the result of material sorting due to freeze-thaw cycles in permafrost regions. Report the sorting of coarse fragments \> 6 cm (greatest dimension) at the soil surface.

| Form     | Code  |

### Surface crusts

Surface crusts are described as layers in Chapter 8.4.31 and further explained there. The area covered is described here. Observe an area (5 m x 5 m if possible) with the profile at its centre. Report the percentage of the area that has a surface crust.

### Surface cracks

Cracks are fissures other than those attributed to soil structure (see Chapter 8.4.10). If surface cracks are present, report the average width of the cracks. If the soil surface between cracks of larger width classes is regularly divided by cracks of smaller width classes, report the two width classes. If different width classes occur randomly, just report the dominant one. The continuity of cracks to a greater depth is reported with the layer description (see Chapter 8.4.13). For every width class, report the average distance between the cracks and the spatial arrangement and persistence of the cracks.

#### Width

## Description of layers

### Identification of layers and layer depths

A **soil layer** is a zone in the soil, approximately parallel to the soil surface, with properties different from layers above and/or below it. If at least one of these properties is the result of soil-forming processes, the layer is called a **soil horizon**. In the following, the term 'layer' is preferred to include layers, in which soilforming processes did not occur.

A soil layer is identified by certain observable characteristics. Among these characteristics are:

-   Matrix colour
-   Redoximorphic features
-   Texture
-   Coarse fragments
-   Artefacts
-   Bulk density
-   Structure
-   Coatings and bridges
-   Cracks
-   Carbonates
-   Secondary carbonates
-   Secondary gypsum
-   Secondary silica
-   Cementation
-   Water saturation
-   Volcanic glasses
-   C~org~ content
-   Human alterations

Wherever you observe a major difference in at least one of these characteristics, set a layer boundary. Whenever a layer is too thick (e.g. \> 30 cm), it may be wise to subdivide it into two or more layers of more or less equal thickness for description. In certain soils, it may also be wise to add additional layer limits at depths, which you may need to check for the presence or absence of a diagnostic horizon (e.g. 20 cm to check mollic or umbric horizons). Alluvial sediments and tephra layers may be finely stratified. It may be appropriate to combine several such strata to one layer for description. In all other cases, different geological strata must not be combined to one layer.

In the following headings, the (o), the (m), and the (o, m) indicate, whether the described characteristic has to be reported in organic or in mineral layers or in both (see Chapter 8.4.4). For organotechnic layers, the user decides, which characteristics have to be described. The asterisk (\*) informs that the characteristic can also be reported in a *Pürckhauer* auger.

The layers are numbered consecutively from the soil surface (see Chapter 8.3.1) downwards. Report the upper and lower depth for every layer. If the lower depth of the last layer is unknown, report the depth of the profile with the + symbol as the layer's lower depth.

The following principles have to be considered for description (see General rules, Chapter 2.1):

1.  All data refer to the fine earth, unless stated otherwise. The fine earth comprises the soil constituents ≤ 2 mm. The whole soil comprises fine earth, coarse fragments, artefacts and dead plant remnants of any size. These rules also apply to cemented layers.
2.  All data are given by mass, unless stated otherwise.

### Homogeneity of the layer (o, m)

#### Layer consisting of different parts

If a layer consists of two or more different parts that do not form horizontal layers but can easily be distinguished, describe them separately. Use separate lines in the Soil Description Sheet (Annex 4, Chapter 11) and report the percentage (by exposed area, related to the whole soil) of each part. Examples are layers with retic properties (see Chapter 8.4.18), with cryogenic alteration (see Chapter 8.4.34) or with remodelling by single ploughing (see Chapter 8.4.39). The separation is not recommended, if there is just a wavy boundary (as typical, e.g., for chernic horizons or for eluvial horizons in Podzols, see Chapter 8.4.5) or if there are just some additions of materials (see Chapter 8.4.39).

#### Layer composed of several strata of alluvial sediments or of tephra

Alluvial strata comprise fluviatile, lacustrine and marine deposits. Tephra strata have a significant amount of pyroclasts. Report the presence of alluvial strata and of tephra strata within the described layer.

| Criterion                                                          | Code  |

### Organic, organotechnic and mineral layers

We distinguish the following layers (see Chapter 3.3):

-   Organic layers consist of organic material.
-   Organotechnic layers consist of organotechnic material.
-   Mineral layers are all other layers.

An organic or organotechnic layer is called hydromorphic, if water saturation lasts ≥ 30 consecutive days in most years or if it has been drained. Otherwise, it is called terrestrial. Hydromorphic organic layers comprise peat and organic limnic material. Report, whether a layer is organic, organotechnic or mineral and, if organic or organotechnic, whether it is hydromorphic or terrestrial. The distinction is preliminary and may have to be corrected according to laboratory analyses.

### Coarse fragments (o, m)

A coarse fragment is a mineral particle \> 2 mm in its equivalent diameter (see Chapter 8.4.9). The subdivision of coarse fragments (0.6 to 60 cm) is according to their greatest dimension. This Chapter refers to natural coarse fragments. Artefacts are described in Chapter 8.4.8. Fragments of broken-up cemented layers are reported here together with the coarse fragments. In addition, the cementing agent has to be reported (see Chapters 8.4.30 and 8.4.32) (the term 'oxides' includes hydroxides and oxide-hydroxides).

#### Size and shape

#### Abundance (by volume)

Report the total percentage of the volume (related to the whole soil) occupied by coarse fragments. In addition, report at least one and up to four size and shape classes and report their weathering stage and the percentage of the volume that is occupied by the coarse fragments of the respective class, the dominant one first. Figure 8.12 helps with the estimation of the volume. For fragments of a broken-up cemented layer, report the agent that caused the cementation, where applicable up to two, and the percentage of each group of fragments (by volume, related to the whole soil).

#### Free large pores between coarse fragments

Between coarse fragments, large pores may exist that are visible with the naked eye and do not contain soil material. Report the total percentage (by volume, related to the whole soil).

### Artefacts (o, m)

Artefacts are solid or liquid substances that are

-   created or substantially modified by humans as part of an industrial or artisanal manufacturing process, or
-   brought to the surface by human activity from a depth, where they were not influenced by surface processes, and deposited in an environment, where they do not commonly occur.

### Soil texture (m) (\*)

#### Particle-size classes

| Particle-size class | Diameter of particles |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Fine earth          | all particles ≤ 2 mm  |
| Sand                | \> 63 μm - ≤ 2 mm     |
| Very coarse sand    | \> 1250 μm - ≤ 2 mm   |
| Coarse sand         | \> 630 μm - ≤ 1250 μm |
| Medium sand         | \> 200 μm - ≤ 630 μm  |
| Fine sand           | \> 125 μm - ≤ 200 μm  |
| Very fine sand      | \> 63 μm - \< 125 μm  |
| Silt                | \> 2 μm - ≤ 63 μm     |
| Clay                | ≤ 2 μm                |

: Particle-size classes, ISO 11277:2009

The particle size classes up to 2 mm are defined according to the equivalent diameter. The equivalent diameter is the diameter of a sphere that in sedimentation analysis sinks with the same velocity as the respective particle.

The human eye and the tactile sense of the fingers can detect particles \> 150-300 μm, depending on individual sensitivity.

#### Texture classes

Report the texture class. Please note that the hand-texturing according to the following flow chart only provides an estimation of the texture. Especially around the limits between the classes, the results might be not absolutely reliable. Beginners should ask experienced soil scientists for help.

#### Subclasses of the texture classes sand and loamy sand

If the layer belongs to the texture classes sand or loamy sand, report the subclass. The particle-size subclasses of sand are detected by visual estimation of the diameters of the grains or by laboratory analysis. The texture subclasses very fine sand and loamy very fine sand tend to feel floury, whereas all the coarser subclasses feel grainy.

### Structure (m)

Structure is the spatial arrangement of soil constituents and pores. If this is, at least partially, the result of soil-forming processes, it is called **soil structure**. Otherwise, it is **rock structure**. Structure refers to the fine earth. Structure is reported for mineral layers. Additionally, structure is reported for drained hydromorphic organic layers.

A **soil aggregate** is a discrete structural body that can be clearly distinguished from its surroundings and that results from soil-forming processes. If a force is applied to a specimen, and the specimen breaks along natural surfaces of weakness, it is composed of aggregates. If the specimen breaks exactly where force is applied, the structure is **massive** (coherent). If there is no coherence between the particles, the structure is of **single-grain** type. Human disturbance may create artificial structural elements, which are called **clods**.

Undisturbed aggregates or non-aggregated structure are called the first-level structure. Aggregates of the types subangular blocky, angular blocky, polyhedral, lenticular, platy, wedge-shaped, prismatic, and columnar may break into aggregates of a second-level structure and even further into aggregates of a thirdlevel structure. The second-level and the third-level structure may be of the same type(s) as the first-level structure or of a different one.

Use the spade, take out a large sample, make sure that the aggregates of the first-level structure, if present, are undisturbed, and observe the structure. Report the type, if present, up to three, the dominant one first. For each type, report separately grade, penetrability for roots, and size class. If applicable, report two size classes, the dominant one first. Report for every type and size class the abundance (as percentage by volume of the layer).

From the first-level structure, take some specimens from each type (if more than one size class of a type is present, take only the greater one) and try to break them with low forces. If aggregates of a second-level structure appear, report the type, if present, up to two, the dominant one first. For each type, report separately grade, size class, and penetrability for roots. If applicable, report two size classes, the dominant one first. Report for every type and size class the abundance (as percentage by volume of the respective first level structure).

From the second-level structure, take some specimens from each type (if more than one size class of a type is present, take only the greater one) and try to break them with low forces. If aggregates of a third-level structure appear, report type, grade, size class, and penetrability for roots. If applicable, report two size classes, the dominant one first. Report for every size class the abundance (as percentage by volume of the respective second level structure).
